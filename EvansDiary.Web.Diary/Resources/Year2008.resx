    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Welcome to a brand new year! A new start for many of you; one that Evan and I are part of. The viewings for the sale of the house were not going well and with the market taking a downturn I made a decision in January to buy Caroline's half of the house meaning that I can now take my time to decorate the house and move in my own time when the markets are more lively.  

I was having a hard time finding a house that was a similar size, for the same price. It was obvious to me that I'd be downsizing if I were to move right now. I do still plan to move away from Slough but this may have to wait a year or so to allow me to get the necessary home improvements done to make the house sellable. We really had let our house slip into a state of disrepair and I'm actually looking forward to doing the old girl up and making it look nice and liveable again.  

The wallpaper in the hallway is finally down *(bringing half the plaster with it in the process!)* I have hated that wallpaper ever since we moved in a shocking 7 years ago and damn it felt good to finally get rid of it!  

**Wishing you all a fabulous 2008!**</value>

    <value>**What night to remember!** Evan went to stay with my mum for a few days this week to allow me to travel to London with friends to watch my beloved Tottenham Hotspur face their arch rivals Arsenal in the Carling Cup semi-final at White Hart Lane.  

We left work at 4.30pm and drove into London, it took us roughly 2 and a half hours to get there but it was worth every minute.  

I was feeling optimistic, Tottenham should have been 1 up from the first leg at Arsenal 2 weeks earlier and I just had a feeling that this would be the year to beat Arsenal. Spurs haven't achieved that since 1999 so most people thought I was mad. However, after last years debacle at White Hart Lane at the same stage against the same team when Spurs were leading 2-0 only to throw it all away and let Arsenal draw the game at 2-2, I just had a feeling that the boys were out for revenge and that the same mistake would not be made.  

I expected a win, but what I witnessed live was unbelievable. 1-0 up after a few minutes had me thinking scoring early was not good as Tottenham are notoriously bad at holding onto a narrow lead. They needed more goals and boy were we in for a feast! 2-0 up at half time, with Arsenal now playing quite a few first team regulars I thought they would come out fighting. They did, but Juande Ramos's blue and white army had other ideas in mind—3 more goals to be precise!  

I was filming the end of the match on my phone, with the 30,000+ supporters all singing *"We're Going to Wembley..."* when the 5th goal went in—absolutely fantastic.  

This was without a doubt the best game I have ever seen Tottenham play live. I Absolutely loved it and I was buzzing for days after this one. Is this the year for Tottenham to win something...? I'm optimistic and I hope they prove the critics wrong and beat Chelsea next month to lift the Carling Cup at Wembley.

    <value>We have another Middlebrook! Yes that's right, we thought there wouldn't be many of us left to continue the name but we're trying our hardest.  

My brother and his wife had their first child this week, a little boy called Ryan Alex Middlebrook. He arrived 2 weeks early weighing 5lbs 14oz. He was so tiny compared to Evan and I was very nervous holding him and he was 5 days old by then!  

Evan and I went to visit Ryan and Evan wasn't really interested in his cousin. He was more interested with Izzy the dog and playing rough daddy type games with my brother Neil!  

I was interested to see if holding Ryan would make me broody. It felt nice and it was lovely to have a cuddle, but I was also happy to hand him back to his parents. My mum keeps asking me if I'm going to start thinking about having a second and I think it's probably not the right time to think about it, even if I did have the money available for more fertility treatment. I now think that by the time you've found someone that you feel is the right person to settle down with and have children and then start the treatment, Evan will probably be about 7 by the time his new brother or sister arrives. Ideally for Evan to get the most out of a brother or sister, *(a little play mate)* then there needs to be a closer age gap, more like 2-4 years.</value>

    <value>Evan and I went to feed the ducks, swans and Canadian geese with my friend Craig and his family today. They live in Thatcham and have a lovely lake and play area near to their house. Evan was a little nervous at first because he'd never met them but as soon as he saw a stack of different toys to play with and yet another guy to throw him around he was all settled as if it were home!  

It was a little mucky where the ducks were and we all got covered in mud. Evan almost ran into a stream but he realised that it wasn't safe and stopped before falling in! When feeding the ducks, it was really hard to keep the kids at a safe distance from the edge. Craig and I almost fell in ourselves trying to make sure our children kept a safe distance—these kids have no fear...  

3 bags of bread later, the ducks were well fed, so was Craig's daughter Hannah—she kept eating it. Now I know why they used fresh bread and not stale mouldy bread!  

Craig did a great job in the play area with the children. Both our kids seem to love the swings more than anything else and we had them in the swings with Craig doing a fine job of pushing them both.  

It was a fun but shattering day. I was exhausted by the time we got home, all that fresh air and running around made me sleepy.</value>

    <value>Today we took a long drive to Dunstable to visit our friends Mel and James and their little boy Sam who had just had his 1st birthday. Sam was about 5 months old when we last saw him and he was cruising around this time and very interested in Evan.  

I've been having difficulty getting Evan to do poo's on the toilet. He's been in pull-ups for a while and he'll quite happily go to the toilet for a wee but everything else seems to still get done in the pull-up. This has been stopping me from wanting to switch him permanently over to pants. He'll sometimes just go to the toilet for a wee and then 5 minutes later do a poo in the pull-ups and it just baffles me why he couldn't have just done that on the toilet 5 minutes earlier!  

We decided to take a walk in the field whilst at Mel's, they are surrounded by countryside and you can't go to the countryside without enjoying it with a nice walk! It was a lovely day, not too chilly and it gave Evan the chance to have a run. He's so fast these days that I struggle to catch him when he's had a little bit of a head start! I lost him in the overgrown grass and he fell into some spiky little bushes.  

We took a detour on the way back to take Evan to the local park and to get Sam off to sleep in his push chair. Evan gets so excited sometimes that it makes him poo and well this is what happened en route to the park. By the time we got to the park he was walking like a cowboy and he smelled pretty bad too! We couldn't let him get to the park and not go on the rides, so we let him play for a little bit. We had one close call when Mel was putting him on the swing and his pull-up almost fell down—euuw yukky.. That was when we decided to walk home. I needed a peg to clear that up when we got home, it was everywhere and I had to try so hard not to gag!</value>

    <value>We had a surprise visit from Caroline this week. She was going to come down to see us for a day but we had the pleasure of having her for the whole week because she'd had a slight falling out with her mum. It's sad that she had the falling out, but Evan and I were the beneficiaries here because we had a lovely time with her.  Caroline and I get on very well, we just slotted right back into place. We know each other so well and generally find each others company pleasant. It did feel odd that this time we were just friends but it also meant that we didn't have to worry about relationship woes, we could just laugh and joke like the old days.  

A few things have changed since she was last around us—I cook more! That's right, I had a roast dinner prepared for her on the first day and we had some meals throughout the week that she doesn't get to eat with her new girlfriend due to food differences. I met her new girlfriend Angie as she stayed over on one occasion that allowed me to go to football training, the first time since Caroline and I had split up. Her girlfriend was a natural with Evan and she was a very lovely lady. She had this natural charm with Evan, getting down on the floor and playing with him almost immediately—it was a joy to watch them.

Evan had another accident at nursery this week whilst Caroline was here. Not as nasty as the first time but it was nice to have Caroline around to help me with him. I had the call at work and you always know when something isn't quite right because they don't say *"He's absolutely fine"* the moment you establish that it is the nursery. He was running around in the quiet room *(shouldn't a quiet room be for calmness!?)*, where the door is a stable door that splits half way. The bottom part of the door was closed and the top part was open and somehow Evan managed to trip hitting the underside corner of the top part of the door. It left a gash in the top of his head, luckily no stitches were required, but he was sporting a crazy looking bandage for 24 hours. We had a few tricky moments getting clothes on and off and Caroline did a great job at coaxing Evan into some buttoned PJ's—he has a phobia of buttons, he absolutely hates them on t-shirts and tops!</value>

    <value>Evan is far more popular than I was when I was little. Today he went to his friend Joshua's birthday party at an indoor play centre called Mad House. This is the 4th party Evan has been to and he had a 5th one, but wasn't able to attend due to already having plans that day. I hope he stays a popular little chap because it's not nice having no friends at school!  

He always takes a little while to get used to a new place and the same applied here. He was rather nervous to begin with and I had to accompany him to the baby area before he started to settle down. I had to get on the climbing frame and chase him around to make him feel more comfortable with the environment. I even managed to get him on the slide.  

I wasn't sure we'd get him on the big climbing area *(where all his friends were playing)* but then I spotted a little car at the top that all the kids were climbing in and I said to Evan *"Lets go and play in the car!"* That was that, we climbed right to the top and he played in the car. We then found some of his friends and I managed to get him to go down the big slide as well. He loved it! *"That was really fast mummy, lets do it again!"* he said.  

We climbed again and met his friend Lara at the top and we all decided to go down the big slide together. This is where it all went horribly wrong. Me being an adult travels a little faster than a 4 year old because I am heavier. I tried to keep hold of Evan but the momentum of me going down faster made Evan flip over and bump his head. I couldn't get him on it after that, he was too scared. We're going to go to Mad House again when I have my holiday at the end of March to make sure that we get him over this little hiccup. He did have a fun day, the slide incident was just a mad mummy moment!  

We had such a great time that I am determined to find a way to give Evan a birthday party this year, although it might have to be in early January because I guess most children will be busy in the Christmas week.</value>

    <value>Today Evan and I went to London Aquarium with my friend Craig and his daughter Hannah. This trip would give Evan his first experience on a train and the tube. It ended up giving us all a lot more than we bargained for!  

Craig left me in charge of bringing the printed tickets—I'm a woman you see and we're good at remembering the important things.  

The day started early at 10am, with Evan using Craig's spare push chair as we gave ours away to my brother. The walk to the train station was pretty uneventful, Craig had to run back for his phone but that was all. We bought the train tickets and just waited for the train. We were just enjoying a casual chat and watching the other trains when Craig asked *"You have the aquarium tickets right?"... "umm... the tickets?—no!!!"*. I looked at my watch, we had roughly 10 minutes before the train was due... I dropped everything and started to run... I ran back to the house to get the tickets and ran back.. I was so close to getting back to the station when I saw the train depart! I couldn't believe it... How could I forget the one thing I was tasked with! The next train would have been ages so we decided to give the children their first experience in a taxi. We caught a taxi to Slough train station from Burnham and caught the next train to London from there. Apparently Evan was all for getting on the train without me and Craig did a great job convincing them that it wasn't really the right train to London!  

The trip to London was pretty uneventful, however it was very hard work. You don't realise just how many steps there are in the London Underground until you have to navigate them with a push chair! I was fairly lucky being a woman, I had a lot of kind strangers offer me a hand going up and down the stairs but jeez it was really really hard work! By the time we got to the Aquarium I was absolutely exhausted and in need of a rest/sleep. We saw the London Eye whilst trying to find the entrance to the Aquarium, which is harder than you might think.  

We were all absolutely starving but couldn't find anywhere to eat, so we just went in to the aquarium and figured we'd sort food out later. That probably wasn't a wise move, it was really uncomfortable for me, though it didn't bother the kids.  

The best feature in there was of course the sharks—Evan absolutely loved it. Every time a shark swam past he got really excited and started shouting *"Look mummy, a shark!"* It really was lovely to watch how excited he got. He liked the ray pool, compared to Evan, these fish were giant and they swim right up to the surface so you can get really close to them. It was very handy having Craig there, he's a diver and knew all the names of the fish, so we were able to just ask him questions and he'd give us all the answers.  

Luckily there was a McDonalds immediately outside the exit to the Aquarium, so that was a handy food choice for us. By that time I didn't really care what we ate as long as it was edible...  

The trip home was just as eventful! We walked past this horror place and outside was a man in a werewolf costume. I thought it might amuse Evan, so I pointed him out. How was I to predict what would happen next?!?!? The werewolf man did a little clawing action to Evan. As Evan turned to look at what I was showing him, his body flinched so violently, his face went white with terror and his eyes opened wide. He launched into this terrified cry and I just had no idea that would happen, Craig had his suspicions though! I was taken aback by his reaction that I initially laughed *(bad mummy)* before trying to console my terrified son. For the rest of the trip home Evan wouldn't stop talking about the "Bearwolf" *(that's what he called it)*. He even had a mini nightmare on the tube when he fell asleep, he woke up all startled saying the Bearwolf was coming to get us in our home!  

We had a few issues on the tube ride home, it couldn't stop at our tube station because there had been a serious incident. I didn't see what it was as we went through Paddington station but Craig who was sitting at the window saw a person lying on the platform with a blanket covering them up :(. Glad Evan and I didn't see that!  

All in all, a very enjoyable first day trip to London. I am very glad I had another adult to share the fun with as I'm not sure I would have coped as well if it were just Evan and me.</value>
