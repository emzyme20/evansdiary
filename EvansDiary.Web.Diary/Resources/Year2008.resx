    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Welcome to a brand new year! A new start for many of you, one that Evan and I are part of. The viewings for the sale of the house were not going well and with the market taking a downturn I made a decision in January to buy Caroline's half of the house meaning that I can now take my time to decorate the house and move in my own time when the markets are more lively.  

I was having a hard time finding a house that was a similar size, for the same price. It was obvious to me that I'd be downgrading if I were to move right now. I do still plan to move away from Slough but this may have to wait a year or so to allow me to get the necessary home improvements done to make the house sellable. We really had let our house slip into a state of disrepair and I'm actually looking forward to doing the old girl up and making it look nice and liveable again.  

The wallpaper in the hallway is finally down (bringing half the plaster with it in the process!). But seriously I have hated that wallpaper ever since we moved in a shocking 7 years ago and damn it felt good to finally strip it!  

**Wishing you all a fabulous 2008!**</value>

    <value>A night to remember! Evan went to stay with Grandma for a few days this week to allow me to travel to London with friends to watch my beloved Tottenham Hotspur face their arch rivals Arsenal in the Carling Cup Semi-final at White Hart Lane.  

We left work at 4.30pm and drove into London, it took us roughly 2 and a half hours to get there but it was worth every minute.  

I was feeling optimistic, Tottenham should have been 1 up from the first leg at Arsenal 2 weeks earlier and I just had a feeling that this would be the year to beat Arsenal. They haven't achieved that since 1999 so most people thought I was mad, but after last years debacle at White Hart Lane at the same stage against the same team when they were leading 2-0 only to throw it all away and let Arsenal draw the game at 2-2. I just had a feeling that the boys were out for revenge and that the same mistake would not be made.  

I expected a win, but what I witnessed live was unbelievable. 1-0 up after a few minutes I was thinking scoring early could be bad as Tottenham are notoriously bad at holding onto a narrow lead. They needed more goals and boy were we in for a feast! 2-0 up at half time, with Arsenal now playing quite a few first team regulars I thought they would come out fighting. They did, but Juande Ramos's blue and white army had other ideas in mind. 3 more goals to be precise!  

I was filming the end of the match on my phone, with the 30,000+ supporters all singing "We're Going to Wembley" when the 5th goal went in - absolutely fantastic.  

This was without a doubt the best game I have ever seen Tottenham play live. Absolutely loved it and I was buzzing for days after this one. Is this the year for Tottenham to win something...? I'm optimistic and I hope they prove the critics wrong and beat Chelsea next month to lift the Carling Cup at Wembley.  

Here's one of the goals for you to share the experience.
