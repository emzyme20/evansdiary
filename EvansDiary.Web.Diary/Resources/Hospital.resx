    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="DayOne" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I seem to remember having a niggling tummy ache in the morning but this all stated at lunchtime. I groaned to Emma about having a rough tummy complaining that I really wasn't due on yet but didn't think much of it. My usual routine with period pain is to make myself a hot water bottle and curl up with a cup of coffee and that's exactly what I did. I made a coffee and grabbed myself a KitKat and took it upstairs. I had a feeling this was gonna be a bitch of a period so I changed out of my jeans into my trackie bottoms (wise move) and then came back down to make myself a hot water bottle.  

####The Collapse 

Something happened right there, I felt immediately faint and the pain was most unusual. I just had to go lie down. As every minute passed the pain worsened - it was like a period pain but way way way worse. Emma came in and looked at me and said she was just about to feed Evan. I stayed there for around 20 minutes or so with Emma popping in every now and then to make sure my groans were not of me dying.  During that time I decided that this seemed too intense for period pain so I shouted to Emma that I wanted to go to hospital. *"For period pain??"* she asked?  

I think she thought I was being a drama queen; she didn't want to go and of course it took time as she had to finish his feed, change his nappy, get his bag ready... Meanwhile I felt like I was suffocating and I had to get some air so I tried hobbling my way outside. I made it as far as the stairs before being overwhelmed with nausea. *"You wanna be sick in this?"*, said Emma holding up the mop bucket! *"Mrphf"* I think was my response followed by the lunch I had just eaten. The puking made us both realise that I was not putting this on. I got into the car and we made our way to A&amp;E.  

####A&amp;E 

I felt dazed, as though my energy was being drained away from me. When we got there I told Emma that there was no way I was going to be able to walk in. Poor love, she had to get me a wheelchair as well as try to push Evan! She got me signed in and came to sit with me. I could feel my head just flopping. I remember her saying that we were probably going to have to wait about three hours. I honestly didn't care at that point - I felt like I was just going to collapse out of my chair, in fact, the pain was so bad that I was actually hoping I would pass out.  

I don't think we had to wait long at all, and Emma wheeled me in to see the nurse. I told her about the pain and I don't really know what happened next but I was being wheeled through into the ward area of A&amp;E. Those good folks gave me a good dose of morphine which finally gave me some relief from the pain. We were there for ages, Emma was being great trying to keep Evan amused as he gradually got more bored and tired. He eventually fell asleep in the pushchair, cutie. I was examined a few times and it was decided that I probably had a bowel problem and I was admitted to Ward 8 - the Surgery ward.  

####The Surgery Ward

I was given more morphine here and I really started to feel better. This ward was a little disconcerting through as I was opposite a little waiting area. There was a man here who was storming around getting stroppy with the doctors - *"I'm in agony here!"* he exclaimed as he walked around the room! Idiot, I'll show him agony I thought to myself... What is it with people like that? There was also a girl in a bed near me who was complaining of a suspected appendicitis. The doctor did not think that was the case and after he left her friends were telling her that she should have screamed when he pulled the pressure away and not on the downward stroke! Now in fact that is the true indication of appendicitis but if you don't have it why on earth would you try to pretend you do?? Jeez...  

I was examined by three different doctors in here including an anal exam by a man! Oh joy! The doctors there concluded that it was more likely that I was suffering from a gynaecological problem which may be related to my endometriosis and so they transferred me to Ward 20. Made sense to me.  

####The Gynaecological Ward

So off on another trolly ride - it was really late at night by now and Emma had gone home to relieve our neighbour who was able to look after Evan at such short notice earlier in the evening. The morphine had kicked in so I was feeling much more comfortable. I had a whole new team of doctors come and poke my belly. I remember the registrar Dr Kroone (nice lady) saying that usually any operations would be done in the mornings but that they were going to discuss whether or not theatre would be necessary that night. I could hear them discussing me at length. One of the doctors said that I was not in much pain now so obviously the problem had gone away. Dr Kroone insisted that my tummy felt and sounded exactly as it had all evening and that the morphine was simply relieving my symptoms. At 3am I was taken to theatre to go check it out. I wasn't nervous as I've had several operations before and I felt a little relieved as I felt sure that I had cyst trouble. The end of a very long day.  

The people on this ward kept Emma well informed of what was happening. She accepted the offer of phone calls at any hour and they obliged this night by phoning at 1am, 3am and 7am - coupled with Evan waking Emma up at 5am, this reminded her of the sleepless nights she had with a new born baby only 6 months ago.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DayTwo" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>####Post-Op

I was returned to the ward at 7am. I don't remember much this day, I was asleep most of the day and I can't really remember Emma and Evan being there just about all day.  

Usually the first few hours post-op are groggy but patients slowly recover during the day and are sometimes sitting up or even moving around by the end of the day. Emma says she knew I wasn't getting better and was really worried about me when she went home. She called my mother for support and that in turn brought forward my mum's visit from Sunday to Saturday (the next day). Emma had obviously said something that had really scared my mother too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DayThree" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>####Something has gone wrong!

I had a hard night. I was feeling like crap and by the early hours of the morning I was convinced I couldn't breathe. I called the nurse who propped me up in bed and seemed to just leave me there. Something was seriously up with my chest.  

Turns out that she hadn't left me there - she had called the intensive care unit! I was suddenly surrounded by three scary looking doctors all having a good prod. I didn't really know where I was going - I was dazed. I was hooked up to an oxygen mask and a load of probes and wheeled off. I was worried. I knew I should be sore after post-op but what happened, where was I going?  

####Intensive Care Unit

As we went down a corridor to a set of large double doors I was told this was the ITU - Intensive Care (apparently officially known as Intensive Therapy). The doors opened and the lights hit me, bright white, stark, brilliantly clean, equipment everywhere and I had like five people around me. I attempted to take in a breath and was pretty scared. *"Scary? This is state of the art!"*, said Carmen when I said the unit was scary.  

A nice guy called Joseph (I love that name) said he was going to be looking after me. In the ITU every bed has a primary nurse attached to it so he must have been mine for that shift. About four people slid me over to an ITU bed, and they started with tubes and drips. The worst thing though was that they immediately tried to put the most horrific oxygen mask in the world on me. It covered my mouth and nose and thrust an intense gust of cold acrid gas into my face. How was that going to help me breathe? It suffocated me! My head went dizzy, I panicked, screamed and ripped the mask off. I had about 4 really nasty moments in ITU - this was the first of them.  

A man called Dr James said that I needed the oxygen to breathe because I couldn't breathe for myself. He showed me his watch which said 10.10 and said 5 minutes, Quarter past ten. Ok, five minutes I could endure. I tried to relax and breathe in on the moments when it blew out the gas. It was horrible though as there didn't seem to be any rhythm to it. Sometimes it would give me a relatively short burst and then on the next one it would blow for ages and as my breathing was shallow I'd breathe in for a moment and then have to close my eyes and just try to endure it. My God, I can feel my heart racing right now as I remember it. Oh yeah, I couldn't speak either so I lost all form of communication - petrifying isolation.  

Dr James said they needed to put in a new kind of line into my wrist - not just a simple canula that they use in A&amp;E. He started poking me with needles - I didn't care. I didn't really mind that kind of pain and I was concentrating on breathing with that mask. But he spent ages, trying two places before giving up. I looked at his watch, it was now 10.25 and I had been on the mask for 15 minutes. Ok not long I thought.  

####Visitors to the ITU

At last, something nice! I suddenly saw my mum and my brother Frank! Boy was I surprised to see them! I had no idea they were going to come all the way from Essex. I saw the look on Mum's face - she looked shocked. I didn't know what the mask looked like but it covered most of my face and had straps all around so I can imagine it was nasty. The unit terrified me when I first saw it so combine that mask with all that equipment, drips etc and it must have been a scary sight. I am so sorry that I have had to put all my family through the experience of seeing me like that.  

Emma had said she was coming to visit but she wasn't there yet. I asked for some paper and a pen and I wrote down that I didn't want Emma to see me like this; I knew how much it would upset her. However Mum said it would be a really bad idea not to let her in - she wants to see me and it would only make her really worried. I was actually thrilled to see Emma when she arrived a few minutes later. The worst part of this time was the lack of communication. I lay there, Mum held my hand and I didn't know what to do. She'd chat a bit to the nurses and occasionally I wrote something down but I remember how awful it must have been to be my visitor that day. (Apparently not as bad as the next days...)  

####Putting in a Central Line

A central line is a tube in the neck or clavicle area! When they told me they needed to stick a tube in my neck I really worried. Needles in the arms, hands, wrists I can handle but in my neck? Are you crazy?? I was right to worry - it was fucking painful and No, I will not excuse my language.  

One of the doctors who had been with me on the day I was brought down to ITU was to perform the task. Joseph would help him. They positioned me, held my arms down (!), and did the anaesthetic. Ow (that's nothing.) He started to insert the line. Oh my fucking god! I screamed my head off as hard as I could. *"Did you feel that?"*, asked the doctor. *"YESSS"* I growled (idiot). Okay more anaesthetic. He tried again, pain shot down my right shoulder. I screamed again, he failed again. He tried again, and again and failed again and again. He tried again and guess what? He failed again. Getting bored reading this huh? Ten times that idiot stabbed a tube in my neck before calling for Dr James. Dr James?? He spent half an hour turning my left wrist black, only for me to find an arterial line on my right wrist when I woke up.  

Dr James failed a further five times. By this time I was just crying. This was worse than I had feared it would be. This is intensive care, why are these people so fucking incompetent? Dr James wanted to start again on the other side, somebody else kept suggesting the clavicle which is just underneath the shoulder blade - this sounded like the least painful option to me. And guess what? That little gem of a doctor managed it in just three attempts! They put a large sticker thing on my neck to cover up their botch-up. No wonder they send relatives and visitors into a waiting room when a patient is being worked on as they would probably make the situation worse by seeing their loved ones going through procedures like this. This was the second of the really nasty ITU incidents.  

####The CT Scan

Over the next hour or two I had various doctors come around listening to my chest, testing stuff. They needed to find out what went wrong after my operation. I was told that I was going to have a CT Scan which is an x-ray technology that they were going to use to look at my chest. They could not transport me to the CT Lab with the oxygen mask as it was quite a journey and therefore they were going to have to intubate me (put a tube down my throat). *Oh my god!* I quickly scrabbled for my paper *"Do you have to put a tube down my throat while I am awake??"*, *"No"*, he reassured, *"So I'll be asleep first?"* I confirmed. The idea of a tube sounded nasty but the idea of being put under general anaesthetic again sounded like heaven! Respite at last...</value>

####(Written by Emma)

Last night we left Caroline just before she was going off to the CT Lab. I did return later that evening (twice) with my mum. I am so glad I had my mum with me as none of us were still expecting Caroline to be intubated. The Doctors hadn't told us that she would likely remain intubated until her condition stabilised.  

She looked far more peaceful being intubated as she was just in what the Doctors described as a happy sleepy place. I cried when I saw her, you see stuff like this on TV in those hospital dramas - this was my reality and I was really struggling to get a grip. I don't think my mum realised how poorly Caroline was until she saw with her own eyes... I'd been very calm earlier that day when I informed her that she was being transferred to ITU. I don't think I realised what ITU meant, I should have been panicking from the outset!

I returned later that night again with some pictures of Evan (a suggestion from my mum), I wanted to make sure that we were there with her and that she saw us first when she would finally wake up from this hell.  

You cannot prepare anyone for a situation like this. The Doctors assured me that Caroline would not remember this and I am so glad she doesn't. I still have the nightmares and I'll never forget what they did and how she looked whilst she was sedated. My mum stayed over with me as I couldn't bare to be in the house alone and she had Evan all day Sunday.  

I spent the whole day beside her bed holding her hand and stroking her face. I cried so much that little sore blisters were appearing under my eyes. Every time I dosed off I'd suddenly awake startled to the sound of an alarm on Caroline's set of machines ringing and I'd wished it had all been a horrible nightmare, but it wasn't... It was my reality. The nurses were ever so nice to me even though they were busy they still managed to comfort me and say nice things to me.  

I'd been there so long the patient in the bay next to Caroline asked a nurse who I was as he had seen me wandering around all day long!  

I was told you can talk to a person when they are sedated like this and that they can hear you subconsciously. The nurses if they spoke loud enough could get Caroline to open her eyes but I found that really scary as she didn't look like my baby girl as her eyes were glazed over and not focusing, just rolling around in her eye socket. I tried my hardest to talk to her but I found myself just whispering into her ear instead of speaking loudly. I just became really nervous and didn't want anyone to hear what I was saying - not that they cared, but it was still personal for me. I think it worked though because I told Caroline some of the things I said to her and she remembers them, she just couldn't tell me when it was.  

You expect older more frail people to sometimes require intensive care but Caroline was young and healthy and I just couldn't understand why she was there. My mum and I tried to speak to a Doctor about this *(Dr James)* and he fed us so much bullshit saying that she probably had an infection before she came into hospital and the ruptured cyst just brought on the infection. He didn't have a clue what was wrong with her and was just trying to scare us off.  

Every time I left Caroline, I returned to find new tubes inside her. First the central line, then the intubation tube, today she had a tube that went up her nose and right down to her stomach. They used this tube to drain yukky looking green bile from her stomach, but they also used it later on this night to give Caroline her first liquid feed - was this a sign she was getting better?  

They checked Caroline's heart today and took her for another special scan to eliminate a possible heart problem. They also scanned her lungs to see if she had any blood clots. Her body had overloaded on fluid and her arms and hands were really puffy and clammy.  

It was lovely to be able to spend all day with Caroline and not have to worry about Evan. I told Caroline's best friend today as I needed to talk to someone and she had a right to know. Caroline had not made any progress at all today and I was more worried than I had ever been. The nights were the hardest for her, she hated being moved or handled and her [sats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation_(medicine)) would drop drastically. I'd wake every morning relieved to have heard nothing from the hospital because at least she was still with us fighting for her life.</value>

    <value>*hello??*

####(Written by Emma)

This was probably the worst day of all for me. I had felt in control since Thursday and today Caroline's mum had arrived because she was ever so worried and she wanted to be able to visit Caroline everyday. I wasn't able to go to the hospital in the day because you are restricted to two visitors and today Caroline's mum and her brother Herve went. I spent the day with Evan at home. We made a collage of Caroline's pictures so that we could see her all the time and Evan actually liked to look at them whilst I fed him.  

I was so lonely today and when Evan was sleeping, I spent my time lying on the sofa crying and sleeping when I was finally exhausted. I hadn't eaten or slept very well since Saturday and my body's strength was starting to wane.  

When Caroline's mum returned from the hospital, I was all set and ready to get my neighbour to baby sit Evan for me when they hit me with a bombshell. I had been stuck at home and in my absence a group of surgeons had decided to operate again on Caroline. They arranged this all with the consent of her mother and I was completely out of the loop. I understand they probably would have gone ahead and done the operation with or without consent but it was her mother's consent they asked for. She was allowed to see Caroline before the operation and no-one even bothered to think of her lover, her life partner stuck at home going out of her mind with worry. They didn't even phone me for an update, I had to phone myself and then it took me ages to get through. People can be so hypocritical, just 48 hours earlier I had been given a lecture by Caroline's family for not phoning them with information. I had specifically asked her mum to just let me know how she was so I would not worry and she said she would, but the phone call never arrived... This was my punishment!  

I just stood there holding Evan in my arms as they broke the news to me. I couldn't hide my tears and I just broke down, trapped in my own home. I was so angry and I never thought I was capable of getting angry with her mum ever, but today I did. She finally understood what I was getting at when I said *"You were able to see her today and you leave it until she is literally on the operating table before telling me. If anything happens to her, I would not have been able to say goodbye. Did it not occur to you that when the Surgeons gathered you into the room thinking that they had all the important people there to discuss this life threatening operation that there was one person missing. You didn't feel the need to say hang on, we need to get Emma here or at least call her...."* It was then that her mother finally realised. She'd been in agony herself these past few days stuck 90 miles away and now she was finally here by her daughters bedside and she didn't need me, I guess my needs just slipped out of her mind.  

My mum hadn't planned to come over today but I needed someone there for me, I felt beleaguered. The next hour seemed to drag on and finally after 2 hours of surgery, the phone rang. The surgeon would only let me know she was in recovery and then insisted that he speak to her next of kin, her mother... I was livid, I threw the phone to her mother and just sat there watching her expressing as the surgeon explained what had happened. I don't think we will ever know what they found as Caroline's mum didn't really understand what the surgeon was saying and only spoke afterwards of them removing debris! I later found out this was not the case, but in fact they had found nothing and only removed some excess fluid.  

When my mum arrived, Pascale *(Neil's girlfriend who had rushed over)* stayed at home to look after Evan and we headed straight for the hospital. I was so upset this night but I was actually relieved to just see her there still alive. She was worse than yesterday and now she also had another serious surgery to recover from.  

Tonight I witnessed Caroline in distress and I tried ever so hard to go to her but my mum just held me back so that the Doctors could deal with her. I cried out, my arms reaching out to her only to find thin air. I'd seen Caroline reach up for the tube yesterday but you could easily move her arms back down to her sides.  

They were suctioning fluid out of her tonight and that caused her to startle, eyes open and arms flaying about. It was a sight I fear will stay with me for a long time to come. The tube even when sedated can cause you to gag and she did it really bad this night. It was awful... *"I wish I could take her pain"* was all I could say as my mum cradled me in her arms.  

We spoke to the Doctors in ITU about the situation with the next of kin and it appears that the records on the main computer system were wrong and that was why the surgery team refused to speak to me. Luckily the ITU records were correct and as far as they were concerned, I was the next of kin. They really were lovely people and I am glad Caroline had such lovely people looking after her.  

I stayed with Caroline until she was all settled and then we left the hospital for the night.</value>

    <value>####Out of CT

I awoke from CT *(pah!)* to find a very uncomfortable tube down my throat, my lips were sore and numb, and of course I couldn't speak. No change there then. Some nurses were around. *"Hi Caroline, it's Tuesday"*. What the fuck?? Where the hell did the weekend just go? I went down to CT on Saturday!!! Man if you've never lost time like that let me tell you what a head-screw it is!  

I had either Emma or Mum with me, I don't remember which. I know I spent a lot of time with Emma that afternoon. Apparently my condition worsened and I had been sedated for two days. The strange thing though is that Emma told me some of the things that she had said to me and I could remember that. Herve had been up to visit me on Monday and I have absolutely no recollection of seeing him. It was truly weird.  

####Communication Breakdown

I wanted to try and write stuff to ask questions and I was given the clipboard but I was dazed as hell. I could hardly see the paper. A few days later the nurse Alex showed me the scrawls I had attempted - they were just that, scrawls. She came to the rescue though, they had an alphabet board which I could use my pointing to letters. We established a routine where I would point to each letter and then pass my hand along the top of the board to signify a new word. *(That in itself was a really hard thing to communicate. Emma was really rubbish at guessing words and in the end I managed to communicate the end of word plan to her by scrawling on paper with a felt tip pen!)* The problem though was that my eyesight and coordination were whack, half the time I couldn't see the letter I wanted and the other time I was pointing to something completely different. Add to that the agony of trying to spell when drugged up to the eyeballs and you can imagine the frustration!  

It was hard for Emma too. She was concentrating on what I was trying to say that she'd forget to repeat the letters out to me. This meant that when I got it wrong she would have the word wrong and we had to keep starting again. Emma kept trying to guess what I was trying to say and then not looking at what I was trying to point at. It was exhausting. *At one point I was pointing, Emma was calling the letter and my mum was writing the letter down onto paper because Emma was having a hard time working out the letter I was pointing to, Memorising the letters in the current word and then also remembering the sentence we were constructing. It was taking so long to communicate that one time Emma actually forgot some of the words and made me start from scratch again!*

####Op Shock

When Emma had come in to visit me she was telling me of the mix-up with consent forms for my operation. I had put Emma as my next of kin even though I know that technically it is my mum. The problem is that I didn't know my mum would be coming up here so I thought it was just easier to put Emma's name down. But apparently this caused a problem. Mum was staying with Emma and they had issues with consent and then also with relaying information over the phone afterwards. Emma was angry.  

Now when Emma was telling me all this I was still very dazed and tired and I thought she was just talking about the op I had had on Thursday when I came in. But apparently not! On Monday after my condition had continued to worsen for two days they suspected that an injury had occurred as a result of the first operation and wanted to operate again to double check and see if they could find anything wrong. This operation was a Laparotomy and they had opened up my stomach from top to bottom! Man!! This was a real shock, two major operations in just a few days? What was my recovery going to be like? I remember the pain of my appendisectomy ten years earlier which was a two inch cut and now I had an 8-inch one and a 7 inch one! The worst thing about it is that they found nothing wrong and could still offer me no explanation as to why I had developed the breathing problem in the first place.  

####Extubation

The tube was really uncomfortable and my lips were so sore. The only brief respite that I had were cotton swabs. These little marshmallow-looking sticks that were dipped in water and wiped around my lips. One of them was going numb. I know the tube was my breathing apparatus and that I had to have it for the CT scan but how long did I need it for? The only thing that scared me was that I'd have to go back to that oxygen mask. Hmm, red raw lips or suffocating gas? What a choice.  

I was now being looked after buy a guy called Eugene and he settled me by saying that once extubated I would be on a much gentler oxygen mask that would allow me to speak. I had a lot of people come around to see me that afternoon - they were relieved that I was awake and looking better. I had given people quite a scare.  

Finally 7.30pm the decision was made to extubate! I was pleased but not looking forward to the occasion itself. I was right to worry, this was to become the third of my hellish moments. Eugene said I was going to have to take in a deep breath but I just couldn't do it! I closed my eyes, breathed out and just winced. It took three big pulls by Eugene. *Euw, euw EUW!* But it was a massive relief to have it out! He swabbed down my lips again and put on a much more sensitive oxygen mask. My throat was raw but I was just about able to speak. I felt better, I wanted to give Eugene a hug but was kinda tired, you know how it is :)</value>

    <value>####On the Mend at Last!

I'd had a rough night - I found it very difficult to sleep with the oxygen mask because the gas was cold on my face and it also blew into my eyes. Plus the discomfort of hardly being able to move and there was stuff going on in the ITU all night long - nurses milling about, alarms going off, being given drips, checks etc. *Ugh!*  

But still, I was awake and on the mend. I had some very exciting news that morning - I was going to have a shampoo!! Seriously, I was pleased about this! I was hot sticky and I had been here a week, I felt yukky.  

####Shampoo &amp; Set!

I was given a bed bath - the nurse soaked the sheets with water and it was a little undignified to be washed naked by a stranger but it felt good. Then they actually gave me a shampoo and I felt human again! There was a Charge Nurse in ITU called Marcus who was quite the charmer. He came over and teased the nurses and said that they should be giving me massages and aromatherapy treatment :)  

####The First Steps

A cute physiotherapist called Mary came over and told me that I was going to be moved into the chair today to help my chest and get my legs moving. Sounded cool to me. I could wiggle my toes fine but when she asked me to lift my legs boy did they feel heavy. She said that after six days of total incapacitation I should expect some serious deterioration in strength and energy. She was right but I was still not prepared for it.  

They brought in the chair, tied up my gown so I was half decent and encouraged me to shift my legs towards the edge of the bed. Then I had to try and put my feet on the floor - Thud! It just splatted into the floor. This was gonna be hard... They brought in a zimmer frame for me and then for the hard part - I had to push up off the bed into a standing position supported by the frame. I took a few moments just sitting on the edge as I felt light headed and then pushed up. My legs felt like jelly and I lurched for the frame. Six days? I thought you might get like this in six weeks perhaps...  

I didn't have to go far, I shuffled a few steps, carefully turned around and flopped back into the chair. They popped out the footrest and I was sorted! I felt quite triumphant. Mum came to visit a few minutes later and it was lovely to see her smile as she saw me looking much better with no tube and actually sitting! Although my throat was very sore I was able to hold a conversation with her so a good change.  

####A funny Turn?

I think I had been sitting there for about an hour when something just weird happened. I felt a hot flooding feeling down below - I was convinced my catheter had become disconnected and I had leaked everywhere. The nurse checked but said it was fine. But I was not fine. I was hot, sweating, my head dizzy and there were the weirdest hallucinogenic patterns running up the walls and curtains! They said I must have just scared myself and given myself a panic attack. Whatever, I'd had enough and wanted to go back to bed. They used the hoist to lift me and lower me into the bed.  

####Hallucinations

There was something seriously squiffy with my eyes and nobody seemed to believe me. On any large flattish surface I could see the patterns running bottom to top. They were like outline shapes of teddy bears or something. I knew it wasn't real but it was disconcerting nonetheless. Even worse was that they didn't go away when I shut my eyes. In fact I started getting all sorts of hallucinations. I would see a face sitting next to me then it would turn into a giant dog cartoon head! I was dozing and constantly thought people were talking to me, I would answer and wake up to find that it was all in my head. I also remember trying to read the cards and the words ran up the page just like the patterns - I just couldn't read them.  

These hallucinations continued all night long and really stopped me sleeping. I had Laura on the night shift who was really nice. I remember one time saying something to somebody then opening my eyes to find her standing there and she just smiled sweetly at me. *"Oh sorry, I was talking to myself wasn't I?"*, *"It's ok"*, she said. I told her about the hallucinations and she said it was probably the sheer amount of medication that I was on.</value>

    <value>####Breathing Improvement

Until now I had been on 70% Oxygen with the mask. Even though I was awake and seemingly better, the fact that I needed so much Oxygen just to breathe was worrying. Apparently they had tried to drop it lower in the night and my sats (Oxygen Saturation) had dropped. In the morning they lowered to 60% and my sats remained stable. A step in the right direction if still a long way to go.  

####Oh Poo!

The previous day I had eaten some solid(ish) food for the first time - a little ice cream. This morning the nurse offered me some toast which sounded good. I had not needed to go to the toilet for days but over the night I kept feeling like I wanted to fart but couldn't :)  

A couple of bites into my toast and I suddenly got a rear-end urge that was no fart! I asked if I could use the commode as I had already been sitting and they said that would be fine. Poor nurses had to spend ages getting me all disconnected so I could go sit on the toilet! I had the runs! It was gross!  

The nurse came back in and I asked for some tissues. *"Oh you're not going to be able to reach honey!"*, *"You mean you have to wipe it for me???"* GULP. Yuppers, I had to leave my runny deposit in their nice little bowl and have a nurse wipe my arse! Highlight of my day (and theirs too :/ ) She sprayed lots of air freshener, lol!  

I was just about to stand up when one of the doctors came in and said that Emma was here. She left then another doctor came in and started talking to me. I felt so awkward. The nurse sensed that the doctor thought I was in a chair, *"She is on the commode..."*, *"Oh, so sorry!"*, said the doctor and said she'd come back later. So I got to stand up and have my bum wiped, niiiiiice.  

####Doctors and Nurses

There's a lot of staff in the ITU. I had a lot or nurses looking after me. I had people coming over to me who I didn't recognise saying *"Caroline, you look so much better!"*. These were people who had looked after me on Sunday and Monday when I had been sedated.  

The doctors would do bed rounds three times a day and one annoyance with that is that visitors had to leave during this time and it would usually take at least an hour to get around everyone. I had already seen many doctors on rounds and they chatted about what could have gone wrong (I don't think I'll ever know), about my oxygen and my recovery in general.  

The doctor from earlier came back and was really encouraging. *"You are 33 years old, let's get you out of here and you can get on with your life"*. Those words will stay with me for a long time. 33 is young, I should have 50+ years of good health left after this. The doctors major concern was my oxygen level. She told the nurse to try dropping it to 40% (that's a large drop) and then if sats are stable to continue from there.  

Well you know what, I was feeling much better and it worked. It went from 60 to 40, to 35 and late at night they dropped it to 28%. That's a massive reduction in one day considering I had been on 70% for such a long time.  

####Walkies!

Mary came by again with another physio Kate. I thought I was going in the chair again but Mary had other plans - I was going for a walk! I really liked the attitude in general of the ITU. I was constantly encouraged to move about, take deep breaths, they were keen for me to push myself and get better. This wouldn't be the case with everybody but that's a story for another day...  

They brought over a portable oxygen tank and the zimmer frame. I was far more easily able to get out of the bed today; quite a remarkable difference in just 24 hours in fact. The frame was very good for support and I wasn't in too much tummy pain either - it was just tiring. It felt good to really move. I had to walk over to a desk and back again, phew!  

####Time to Go?

The other doctor that had also spoken to me in the morning was also very pleased with my progress. She came to speak to me late in the afternoon when my oxygen was at 35%. She said she thought that I was now ready to leave the ITU but that they may as well keep me another night as they were not short of beds. This suited me as I felt very safe in the ITU with somebody on hand for my every little whim 24 hours a day and I was still concerned about the oxygen. Emma and my mum were also pleased as they just didn't want me to go back to the ward.</value>

  <data name="DayNine" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>####Full English Please!

I felt pretty good Friday morning and although I wasn't exactly looking forward to going back to the ward (so boring), I was pleased because I knew how much better I was and it also meant the end of being restricted by so many drips and lines.  

Laura had done her third night shift in a row. She was by far my favourite nurse :) I felt hungry in the morning and she said that I could get a cooked breakfast from the kitchens and this I did! Sausage, bacon, egg, hash brown, beans and tomato! I couldn't eat it all but I ate bits of it all and it actually wasn't that bad :) I said goodbye to Laura and thanked her for all her help and was introduced to Amy who was to be my last ITU nurse.  

Amy was great - young, down to earth, sarcastic and very funny. She made me a coffee to go with a cooked breakfast and suggested that I have a real shower before I go! Funny that Emma and I had been talking about the shower room (it was opposite my bed) and that it was probably unused in this unit. I was a little embarassed having to be completely naked in front of a stranger but it did feel good to have a shower. Though I found two big rows of blisters either side of the lower scar - turns out that I had developed a reaction to the dressing, *Euw!*  

####Prepping for Return to the Ward

I sat in the chair for a couple of hours in the morning and I had visits from Marcus the charge nurse who organised the bed from the ward and Kate the physio who worked with Mary. At this point I was still on the oxygen so Kate said lets just take it off and see how she does. I did a couple of deep breaths while she listened to my chest and it felt really good to have the mask off.  

Amy returned me to the bed for a final blood sample and so that I could have my lines removed. I had to be flat on my back for the removal of the one in my neck. She removed the one from my wrist which was nice as that was a really big beast. The bed was taking its time and Amy had to help with the lady in the bed next door so the morning slowed down and I had a little sleep.  

Later I was woken up to some bad news. My blood had shown a drop in Sats to 89% (usually they were 95+ with the mask on) so I had to have the mask back on and this meant that it had to go with me to the ward. This would prove to be the bane of my weekend.  

The line in my neck was removed - *shiver* that felt weird and no wonder putting it in had bloody hurt, it was about 8 inches long and about 3mm thick! Finally I was ready to go, there was a little delay as the lady next door had to go to theatre at the same time as I was supposed to leave. My eyes had finally sorted themselves out (no more patterns!) so I took the opportunity to re-read all my cards. Mel's one made me cry again :(  

I finally got down to the Ward by about 1.30pm.  

####Back on the Ward *yawn*

Amy took her time over the handover (I think she was stalling as the day shift ends at 3pm) so I was getting hungrier by the minute. Once she left and the nurses came to see me I asked for something to eat. All they had was a piece of baguette with smoked turkey. It was pretty awful. My lips were still very painful and it was very uncomfortable to try to get my chops around a baguette.  

It was nice to have the freedom to move around by myself. I was now able to just go to the toilet whenever I liked so I could go clean my teeth, freshen up etc... which was nice. The main problem with the ward is the sheer boredom. There is the occasional blood pressure check and in my case, sats check but that's it. Nobody to talk to, nothing to do, nothing going on.  

####Surprise Visits

Thankfully I had a visit from Emma in the afternoon and she was able to bring Evan with her! It was nice to see him and he played on my bed like a little cutie. Emma looked relieved that I was obviously out of danger now. I didn't want Emma to go but Evan was getting a bit fussy so she had to. But before she left I gave her my list of demands! I made her go to the shop and buy me sweeties, magazines, puzzle book and most importantly of all - a card for the personal TV that I had by my bed! This she did so I was able to watch TV after she left.  

I didn't need it for long however as about half an hour later who should pop round the corner than Sharon! It was just coincidence that she had tried to get in touch to arrange to drop in and as my phone had been off for a week she phoned the house and spoke to Emma who told her I was in hospital. It was nice to catch up on all of her gossip!  

####Night-Time Struggles

The evening was tolerable - I was comfortable, the dinner wasn't bad (Chicken Biryani) and I had my TV though all that seemed to be on was Big Brother! Night time was tough though - that damn mask made my face cold and kept blowing in my eyes and the ward beds weren't adjustable like the ITU ones so I couldn't get as comfortable. Plus my bed was right next to the nurses desk so I could hear them milling around.  

I had only eaten half of my dinner earlier and I was getting hungry and it was going to be enough to stop me getting to sleep so at about 4.30 am I asked the nurse to make me some toast! Yumm :) I finally settled back down to sleep just before 5am hoping to get another 2 hours or so.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DayTen" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>####A Bloody Awakening

After finally managing to get back off to sleep again I was rudely awakened by the nurse at only 6am, she was giving me blood! I was to be given two units of blood. Apparently the main reason that my sats weren't quite tip-top was that my haemoglobin levels were low and that was restricting the oxygen I could take in.  

The blood needed around 2 hours per bag and it was a thick ol' tube so I was a bit restricted. I sat up so I could read and I must have dislodged the line. The nurse came over and pointed out that my line had twisted and the flow had stopped. She tried to kick it off again but it just wouldn't start so she told me she'd have to call the doctor to insert a new one.  

####Lines of Pain!

In the ITU I had loads of lines, they kept flipping around on my wrists. With the exception of the neck one, they hadn't been too bad. The doctor came to visit me and decided to try the back of my right hand where I had a large black scab from an earlier line but a puffy looking vein. Backs of the hands hurt so this was painful. She just couldn't get it. She made four bloody attempts before giving up and calling for an anaesthetist.  

When he came along he game me an explanation for the doctor's failure. The vein had probably clotted slightly in response to an earlier line and this clotting not only meant that no blood would pass through it enough to get a line in, but that it would appear puffier than usual. You'd think the doctor would know this?  

The anaesthetist prodded around my arms for ages before deciding to try right in the middle of my right forearm. Ouchiebuggery did that hurt! He had some tricks... he tried pumping some blood into it and he tried flushing it but he couldn't get it unfortunately. It was painful but I felt more confident in his abilities than the doctors. He did scare me a little however when I asked him what happens when they run out of arm space, *"There's always the feet"* he said. *eyes widen*.  

He tried the other forearm and got it immediately. Phew! It was sore but I just put up with it and pretty much stayed put for the next few hours. That earlier line attempt would develop into a huge black bruise over the next few days.  

####Get This Mask Off Me!

I had now been back on the Oxygen for 24 hours and I was getting really frustrated. They had made no attempt to lower the oxygen level or to measure me without it and I hadn't seen the doctor. I spoke to the nurse about it and she just said *"Oh it's good for you, we've had instructions that you are supposed to have it at all times"*.  

I told her that they had encouraged me to remove it in ITU and that it was time to check again. *"How can you know how well I breathe if you don't take my sats on room air?"*, I challenged. I took the mask off, told her I was keeping it off and asked her to measure my sats later. She agreed grudgingly.  

They checked me a couple of hours later and it was 96% which I was very happy with. *"It's not 100%"*, stated the nurse. It wasn't 100% on Oxygen ffs! The damn machine sits there fluctuating by a couple of points the whole time the probe is on my finger anyway.  

Later in the evening it dropped to 93% (big deal) and everybody including Emma insisted I put it back on. This thing was starting to drive me crazy and my frustration was starting to come through.  

####Mask On, Socks On, Jeez!

To add to my frustration another nurse came over and insisted that I wear bed socks. I had already had them removed in ITU two days ago so why on earth would I need them now when I spent more time sitting in the chair then in the bed? *"All post-op patients need them"*, she lied. I didn't see any other patients at all in the ward who had them! This day was really starting to grate... 

####Losing the Frame

Until now any movement had been with the help of the zimmer frame for support but I noticed that I didn't seem to be leaning quite so heavily on it. After lunch I went to the toilet and decided to try without it - I just carried my bag with me and walked normally. What was nice was that I came back to my bed to find my mum and both my brothers waiting for me so mum was thrilled to see me walking around without support.  

####My Brothers Come to Visit

It was nice to see my brothers. Those two can always be relied upon to make plenty of jokes :) I must admit Frank did actually manage to come up with a witty one: *"That's what you call taking the piss!"*, in response to seeing me walking around with my wee bag in my hand!  

The lunch menu that day had been just vegetables or manky sandwiches so I got my brothers to stock me up and they did - cheddars, KitKat kubes, dairylea lunchables! Not exactly the healthiest of choices but at least my appetite was growing again. I was also making the most of the tubs of fresh juice they had on the ward, I think I went through six tubs that day!  

Emma had told me that her mum was coming over to have Evan for the day so she could spend lots of time with me so I was expecting her the same time as my mum but she didn't arrive. *"I bet she's out shopping with her mum"*, I said. My brothers decided to ring her *"Oh, we just popped to Mothercare, be there in ten!"* hehe :)  

Mum stayed until Emma arrived and then Emma said she was staying until kicking out time 8pm which was really nice. We had a loooooong chat about our plans for the future and started talking house improvements! It was really nice.  

####Hammer Night of Horrors

After Emma left I read my magazines and watched lots of TV until quite late - I was not looking forward to the night time again. This was the worst one for noise! I managed to sleep for 2 hours and woke up at 2.30 to the sound of the girl in the bed next to me groaning. She promptly puked her guts up, poor love!  

There was a new nurse on who wasn't such a pain in the butt as the others. I told her the mask was making me really cold and I said I was willing to try the nasal prongs which I didn't like. As luck would have it, they had already looked for them and didn't have any so she told me to take the mask off and said she'd check me during the night to make sure my sats didn't drop too much. Result!  

By about 3am I was fully awake so I chucked on the TV. Craig &amp; Anthony in the Big Brother house can always be relied upon to be up at silly times talking about absolute crap! The nurse at the desk was filing her nails really loudly and there was snoring coming from at least two beds so I knew there was no hope of getting to sleep. I decided to keep watching the telly until the noise settled down.  

At 3.50am the filing stopped but she was just adjusting her chair, she carried on for another ten minutes after that. One of the other nurses came around and I asked her to take my catheter out which had been agreed earlier. This was great because I was able to dump the skanky gown that I had been in for a whole week and put my own pyjamas on. I settled down to sleep again at about 4.30 and managed to grab another couple of hours.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DayEleven" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>####And I'm Feeling Great...

Despite only four hours sleep I woke up feeling good! Laura and Leanne in the beds next to me and opposite were chatting and I joined in and had a cup of coffee. Even before I got up I could really feel the difference, I was going home today.  

####Shower Time, Yeah Baby!

After a crappy breakfast I decided to really freshen up and have a shower. The hospital was able to supply me with shampoo and shower gel which was handy because I didn't have any of that kind of stuff with me. I was in there for ages - all my skin was rubbing off, yuk! I washed my hair, cleaned my teeth, ditched the stupid bed socks and put on some real clothes. For the first time in ages I didn't look like Elvis!  

I went for a nice walk outside then came back and sat in my chair and watched a bit of telly.  

####Dr Sweat

Around 11am I had a visit from two doctors. One of which was this big sweaty man with a strong accent who said he'd been observing my operations. I told him I wanted to go home and he said that the problem was that the second operation that had been performed on the Monday had been carried out by a surgical team and they would have to check me out and sign me off for release. They said they'd try to get the surgical team round to see me in the afternoon. That brought a smile to my face.  

####Mask Stays Off

My sats were checked again just before lunch time and I'd had the mask off since 2.30am the night before so we were approaching 12 hours now. 96% again! I even managed to get them to turn off the machine this time. There was no way in hell I was wearing that thing again.  

####Chinese &amp; Campers

The night before Emma had picked up a chinese on the way home from hospital and eaten it with her mum but she'd saved me some and planned to come and bring it to me for lunch today. My breakfast had truly sucked and all I'd had was a piece of toast. She was late! Typical.  

At 2pm I was delighted to see Mel &amp; James who had come to visit me on the way back from a camping trip! Emma followed in with Evan and the much anticipated chinese! Lunch in style, yesss :)  

At about 3pm I still hadn't heard from the surgical team so I asked the nurse. I didn't really want to have to ask her because this was the lady who I had been fighting with over the Oxygen mask the day before. I asked her if she's heard from them and she said *"Well, there is only one surgical team on over the weekend and if that is not the team that did your operation then they won't discharge you"*. I told her that I wasn't going to endure another night due to a technicality and said I would discharge myself, and could she ring them anyway.  

She came back later saying that the surgeon had just entered theatre and would be unavailable for 4 hours. This pissed me off but what was more annoying is that Emma, Mel &amp; James all thought I should just stay in hospital.  

When they left Emma made a very stupid remark *"Well, what about your TV card that you haven't used, I must have spent £80 quid on you!"*. I couldn't believe she said that *"Well, I'll just stay here so you can get your fucking money's worth"*, I replied and stormed off back to the ward and immediately cried. Great, even if I did discharge myself I wasn't going to be wanted at home. What fun it is to be me right now.  

She did eventually come back in and apologised and said she didn't really know why she had said that. Mel also came back in to try and comfort me but neither seemed to understand the frustration I was feeling. I knew I was better, I knew I would be more comfortable at home, that I didn't need anymore hospital care and that I definitely would not be able to sleep in the hospital ward.  

I was at the end of my tether at this point. I was so angry. I cried for about an hour then I went outside and managed to find a secluded spot to sit and I just stayed there for about half an hour. I didn't want to see anybody or talk to anyone. I finally got back to the ward at 5.40 and just watched some TV until dinner time.  

####Dr Liar

I was very surprised to see Emma again at 7pm. I had been planning to take a taxi home though I hadn't thought that one through because I had no money and no credit card!  

I had been hanging out for this surgical doctor for hours and he never came but the sweaty doctor from earlier came back but he completely denied what he said in the morning! *"You've had major surgery and this is too soon to leave the hospital"*, he said. Such a blanket statement! What's too soon? I had the operation on Monday and it was now Sunday night, almost a week later. Rarely are you kept in that long and he could see the improvements. He totally denied saying that he'd earlier agreed to letting me go home and said I'd have to wait to see Dr Dimitry (guy in charge) in the morning.  

####Home Time

I couldn't take it. Nope, no way was I spending another night in there just because it was Sunday and nobody could be arsed to discharge me. I discharged myself and went home.  

####The End

This is the end of my story but not the end of my journey. As I write this it is currently Wednesday and I have been out of the hospital for three days. At times it's been even more frustrating being at home where Emma and I have been suffering from a communication breakdown. The worst is over now, she no longer has the urge to send me back every five minutes and I'm even sleeping a little better.  

This has been the most terrifying, traumatic, painful, emotional and frustrating 11 days of my life. But I also believe that this will now change my life. I never want to go through that again, I need to stay fit and healthy and away from hospitals. I still have to deal with the Endometriosis which is the disease that caused the cysts and that will continue to rampage until my menopause unless I do something to stop it but that's another story...  

I want to thank everyone around me for all their love and support over this very difficult time. I'm sorry you all had to go through it. Never again.</value>
