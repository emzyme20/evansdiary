    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>My experience of the birth is totally different to that of Caroline's. When I think back, parts of it are now starting to blur and I need reminding from those that were present to relive certain events. I guess the pain relief through drugs and that of my natural pain relief are part of the reasons for me not remembering it. I personally handled being pregnant and going through the labour better than I would have handled being the partner who felt completely helpless at times.
    
For two days I was having contractions and I really thought I was doing really well to have lasted with just the TENs machine. I wasn't at the time aware that my waters hadn't fully broken. When I was examined on Christmas Day and the midwife told me that I hadn't dilated at all I was devastated. All I could think of was that the pain I was having was obviously going to get worse. I have never been one for doing things the simple way and literally an hour after contacting my mum to tell her that she was unlikely to get the phone call to get in the car, I started having a contraction that felt just like all the others. I started to puff on the entonox and something inside went pop and all I felt was this gush. I remember hobbling to the toilet in my room shouting back to Caroline to get a midwife quick. When the midwife glanced down and saw the meconium she calmly said that I needed to get to the labour ward as one way or another this baby was going to be delivered. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, to suddenly go from being told that I was probably going to have to be induced the next morning to then having this happen was just typical of me, but I was happy that the baby had finally decided to come.  

This is when things start to go a little hazy for me. Caroline contacted my mum to tell her to make her way to the hospital. My birth plan went out the window because I originally wanted an active labour and also wanted to avoid having an epidural. I had to be monitored throughout the whole labour to make sure that the baby didn't go into distress because of the meconium. The induction drip was causing my contractions to become stronger and the pethidine and entonox were not being much help at this stage. I finally agreed to have the epidural and the anaesthetist was really good, she administered the epidural really quickly allaying all my fears of the procedure. The epidural only worked on one side of my body so I needed another dose, which caused my right side to get too much. It was quite funny when my leg kept falling off the bed and I had to ask people to pull my leg back up onto the bed. I don't recall much pain after this, I was finally able to doze off (even mid-way through conversation). I'd only had 3 hours sleep over the past few days and it was all finally starting to take its toll on me.  

Thinking back to when the midwife went to lunch, I started to feel intense aching pains in my left buttock. It felt like the worst dead leg feeling you could imagine, everyone thought it was really funny and in the end I had my epidural topped up because it was hurting continuously. I can only assume that this was me feeling the contractions as the baby moved down on his own because when I was reexamined upon the midwifes return from her break, she encountered the baby's head. I couldn't believe my ears, this labour had suddenly gone from doing nothing to everything happening. I was so pleased because I was worried it would go to a c-section, which was not what I wanted. We had a few trial pushes and then waited 40 minutes for the epidural to wear off some more.  

The pushing stage was surreal, sometimes I couldn't feel the contractions and pleaded with the midwife to tell me when to push. She was brilliant and I don't think I will ever forget her. If things ever got a little scary, she never let on and remained completely calm. It was all hands on with my mum, Caroline and the midwife all helping me to push. I wish I could have seen what was happening, but then maybe that would have stressed me out. The cord around the neck was my worst fear throughout pregnancy and when it turned into reality I became a little hysterical. I was told to stop pushing and that is easier said than done! and the cutting of the cord seemed like a life time. When Caroline started to cry I feared the worst, but hearing his tender cry after I pushed his body put turned my tears into happy tears. Watching the medical staff clearing his air ways was awful, it looked such a painful procedure. Hearing his hearty cry afterwards made me feel over the moon.  

I don't remember much after that, I was absolutely drained physically and emotionally. It was a long time before I was able to hold my son and I really wanted us to bond straight away. When I finally held him for the first time, I was besotted, it was all worth it.  

Things I will never forget... The relief I felt inside when the placenta was delivered, it felt like I had just lost a couple of stone. Being sick, I was sick several times and managed to do so on everyone including the machine that I was hooked up to! The feeling of complete happiness I felt when I held my son for the first time. The amazing people that were with me throughout my delivery and hospital care. If only I could have the same people there for number two!</value>

    <value>Watching your loved one go through the pain of labour when there is virtually nothing you can do to alleviate her pain is heart-wrenching. As the labour drags on and on sapping every ounce of her energy and Christmas Day fades into Boxing day it's hard to imagine that this little baby will ever actually be born...  
    
The first signs of labour started early on the morning of Christmas Eve. Emma's waters appeared to break so she phoned the hospital and they advised her to come in due to risk of infection. The problem with this is that she had to go through all the first stage of labour in the discomfort of a hospital ward which is not what we wanted. The labour continued for what seemed like forever, including the whole of Christmas Day.  

At around 7pm on Christmas Day Emma had a contraction that didn't feel right. "Something just went pop!", she said! Her waters had already broken but this time there was a lot more. Unfortunately it was green coloured which indicated that Evan had poo'd inside of the womb. The first poo consists of something called meconium which is green. This can be dangerous for the baby if he ingested it so Emma was taken down to the labour ward to be induced. Even though we were a little worried about this meconium it was reassuring to know that this labour was really going to get underway!  

The contractions got stronger, closer together and more painful but there was still no real progress - no dilation, despite the induction. Christmas Day passed and still nothing. Shortly after midnight the midwife examined Emma again and found her to be dilated to a fingertip :/ She went off for her break at about 1am and said she'd re-examine Emma again upon her return and if there was still no progress she'd discuss our options with the Doctor. I heard them mention the C word (caesarean) which we were rather afraid of.  

However, when examined again shortly before 3am we were all amazed to hear the words "Hello Baby!". Emma was fully dilated and the head was moving down. Great news, at last! No C-Section necessary. We waited a little while longer firstly to allow the baby to travel down further on his own to reduce the need for so much pushing and secondly to allow the effects of the epidural to wear off a little more so that Emma would be able to feel the sensations of the contractions so she'd know when to push.  

The pushing started at 3.45 and the midwife and I both stood on one side of Emma as supports for her legs to give her a bit of help! By 4.05am Evan was born but those 20 minutes were the most emotional of my life. I had so many different emotions running through my head at a time that I found it hard to cope. Watching Emma going through all that pain was unbearable and as Evan's head began to emerge I felt an incredible sense of fear that something was wrong as he was such a strange colour. (No amount of birthing TV shows and photos in magazines helped with the shock of the real thing!) The fear was made worse when the midwife shouted that his cord was around his neck! Thankfully it took them just a moment to snip off the cord and he was out in one more push but it was still incredibly frightening, exciting, and overwhelming all at the same time.  

It's an experience I will never forget and with this diary I hope that I'll never forget any of the experiences that are to come as Evan develops and grows up...</value>

    <value>My recollection of days and times became completely muddled after the birth of Evan. I was wheeled up to the postnatal ward at 7am in the morning and because we then went to bed it actually feels like I was in hospital for a day longer than I actually was. I didn't get much sleep at all and 2 hours later I woke up feeling terrible. My right leg was still completely dead and I couldn't move at all. When Evan started to cry I couldn't tend to him because of my problems with the epidural and I didn't have a nurses buzzer at the bedside either. In a panic I remember asking one of the other patients to press her buzzer for me, we had language difficulties though as she knew very little English. Instead she pressed the emergency alarm and about 10 nurses arrived at our beds less than a minute later. My nurses buzzer was fixed shortly after that incident. That first morning dragged on, I now had Evan in my arms and we just lay on the bed waiting for Caroline to arrive. I waited for as long as I could before requesting assistance from the nurses to help me and my one working leg to the toilet, I was hoping Caroline would have made it in because it would have been more dignifying having her help me. My leg felt strange as the feeling very slowly returned, I could touch my leg and feel the sensation of touch but I couldn't feel it directly underneath my fingertip. I was glad when the full sensations finally returned later on in the evening, I was beginning to wonder if it would ever return!  
    
Evan was very quiet in hospital, he hardly ever cried. Caroline looked great with him and she did all the mucky stuff while I just rested and relaxed. I think I only changed the nappies at night time when she wasn't around! The nurses were absolutely fantastic in hospital and it was really nice knowing that there was someone who knew what they were doing on the end of the buzzer. I didn't realise how much I missed them and the security of having them around until we finally went home the following evening. I remember waking up in the middle of the night following Evans birth for a feed and nappy change only to find that Evan's right eye was stuck together (known as sticky eye). I didn't know what to do, I couldn't get him to open it and I panicked. The nurses were great though, they bathed it and showed me what to do if it happened again and I was very glad that they were there.  

The hormones definitely play havoc with your system, I found that once we had left the security of the hospital environment and were now at home alone with the task of being parents, things really started to sink in and I did experience the baby blues for several days. I'd walk into a room and Caroline would see me crying and I couldn't tell her why. It's a really strange feeling, the simplest of things can just set you off. I found that the feeling of uncertainty and not knowing if I could cope without the help from the nurses would easily start the tears for me.  

I was surprised by the amount of visitors we had, almost everyday we had someone new wanting to see Evan or a delivery at the door with presents for him. It's amazing the effect babies have on people, some of the visitors had never even seen our house and that was 3 years on from when we moved in! Before the birth I speculated on how many visitors we would get because we don't have a very big circle of friends and our families aren't really that close that we see each other often, however I was quietly surprised by the amount of people that did come to welcome Evan into the world.  

We still had the visits from the community midwife to make sure that we were coping and recovering well after the birth so it was nice to know that we were only a day or two away from a health professional if we needed some advice. I was expecting Evan to lose a fair amount of weight after the birth and the midwife even told us that if he did then it was nothing to be worried about. To our surprise our little 8lb 10 baby weighed in at 8lb 8 when the midwife weighed him. Her comments following the weighing were "Well we can certainly see that you are not having problems breast feeding!" That's my boy, he certainly likes his food and he is a real guzzler too.  

We only had the one scare in the first week, I managed to give Evan a little bit of diarrhea after taking some lactulose to help me go to the toilet for the first time since the birth 3 days previous. The contents of his nappy turned green and stringy one night and I stupidly assumed that that was the Chinese seaweed that I had eaten earlier passing through to him. I can't believe I actually said that at the time and Caroline just laughed at me and posed the question "How can seaweed turn into milk and then somehow turn back into seaweed inside him?". Yes yes, it's the hormones! We actually telephoned NHS Direct that night to see if it was anything to be worried about as we had already had all the varying different coloured poo and was not expecting it to go back to green after the mustard coloured. It wasn't anything to worry about and we were just being typical new first time parents, getting worried over absolutely everything.  

Things that I'll never forget about the first week... The few nights that Evan slept really well, being able to just sit on the sofa with him lying beside me looking absolutely adorable. In that first week I felt completely contented just sitting down cuddling him while he slept peacefully in my arms. Enjoy those moments while you can because life finally has to speed up again and get back to normal.</value>

    <value>Emma and Evan were taken up to the postnatal ward at about 7am and we were all thoroughly exhausted. Her mum and I waited until they were both settled and then went home for some well-earned sleep! The drive home was weird. It was about -3 outside and the car was frozen solid. To me it was the end of a very long night but in reality the day was just starting. As I started to drive the emotion of it all really hit me and I had tears streaming down my face all the way home. I slumped into bed and managed to get about 3 hours sleep...  
    
Going back into hospital that afternoon was equally weird as it felt like the next day. I was so tired that I almost crashed on one of the roundabouts on the way in! I remember thinking to myself that the next time I would see Evan he'd be about twice the age he was when I last saw him! Of course, that's only a few hours but I was worried that he'd have changed completely and I wouldn't recognise him.  

The midwife had phoned me at home just before I left the house saying that Emma had been asking for me so I envisaged walking in to a bedraggled girlfriend and a screaming baby! I was pleasantly surprised to see Emma sitting up in bed with Evan fast asleep and sprawled out before her on the bed. I just had to take a photo and it's one of my favourites of the early ones.  

Shortly after getting to the hospital I was faced with my first dirty nappy. You know, I had actually completely forgotten that babies needed nappy changing (doh!) It was pretty mucky (and I took a photo of it too!) but I didn't mind at all, it was actually kinda cute! I felt a bit intimidated though having to change my first nappy in front of the midwife and I also felt very awkward handling him.  

The next few hours I remember spending ages just looking at Evan, trying to "learn" his face. By the following day I had also started to learn his voice and if I was out in the corridor I was able to distinguish his cries from that of the other babies.  

I was really worried about coming home with Evan because we have three cats and we were quite apprehensive about their behaviour towards him. We anticipated that Treacle would be so scared of this noisy thing that she'd spend 6 months hiding under the bed, Poppy would probably hiss at him lots and Cleo, once she figured that he wasn't edible, would just lose interest. We were right about Cleo but Poppy is quite the opposite. She loves to be around him and when he cries she perks up, walks right over to him and gives him a good sniff. She also guards the door when he's in the bedroom on his own and meows to go in there, little cutie. Treacle is being remarkably brave (she's an incredibly scatty cat!) and she's quite a sight to watch as she tip-paws up to him, has a tentative sniff and then jumps out of her fur and bolts at the slightest sniffle! Anyway there's no hissing so we're pleased.  

All the visitors we had in the first week were rather disconcerting. They were mostly Emma's relatives and seeing as Evan isn't biologically related to me I can't help but feeling like a bit of an outsider. I'm hoping that feeling will pass with time. For now I've just been playing host, making everybody cups of tea and letting them pass him around like a new toy.  

Our first trip outside of the house was a bit of an adventure! We figured we'd go to Mothercare as that's a nice "safe" environment to take a baby and if he cried it wouldn't be as embarrassing as it would be in the local supermarket. Well, that was the theory anyway. After struggling with the pushchair for ages we finally made it into the shop. Emma had to go off and get measured for a nursing bra so I was left with Evan hanging out in the underwear section! My worst fears were realised when he started to cry, then howl, and finally scream! I picked him up rather awkwardly and tried my best to hide behind the huge disposable knickers! It seemed like an age before Emma came back and I just handed him straight back to her - "your baby!". Naughty I know :-)</value>

    <value>After the crazy hectic first week at home, most people we knew had managed to see Evan and the daily visits had died down. I had been warned in pregnancy to expect my washing machine to be busy and I am starting to see that now. On average we are doing 2 loads a day when before having Evan I'd only have the washing machine on 3 times a week! I just hope my washing machine survives the extra workload as even before Evan I noticed it was starting to groan lots.  

The long hard nights started this week and Evan was becoming as regular as clockwork with his "rattyness" starting around 7pm. We'd struggle to settle him for most of the evening, bed time being the hardest. It doesn't help that he really dislikes lying on his back, his favourite position being upright against my chest with his head nuzzled under my chin.   

This year was the very first time that we spent Christmas at home together in 7 years. Usually we are at either mine or Caroline's mums house but seeing as I was heavily pregnant, we decided to stay at home. We were hoping Evan would arrive early and then we could have a Christmas dinner with him so we stocked up on everything, turkey, vegetables and we even planned to make a nice Christmas dessert. All of this ended up in the bin when we returned home from hospital but we weren't to be deterred. We bought a new turkey and Caroline cooked us our Christmas dinner this week. It was lovely and I'll never forget how funny it looked when Caroline was trying to rinse out this huge turkey in the sink, holding its legs in the air. I found it incredibly hilarious that I filmed it on the camcorder, unfortunately I didn't take any static photos of this particular event.  

We had an early appointment this week to get Evan registered and of all the nights where we really needed our sleep was the night before this day. We could not get Evan settled at all, he cried so much it made me cry too. We tried rocking, singing and cuddling but none of this would settle him at all. We were really concerned that something was seriously wrong with him and this night we called the labour ward for advice. I had to take the call in another room and the midwife could still hear him crying. She put it down to a bit of colic and said that we needed to stay strong, give him a bath and to maybe put him on the boob every time he became distressed to calm him. The feeding turned out to help hugely, though it was really rough for me and my boobs. We took it in turns to pace the room cuddling him as well as the feeding trick. We managed to get around 3 hours sleep that night and amazingly we were able to get up, washed and dressed in time to leave the house at 9am. I think Evan and I slept in the car, but poor Caroline had to do the driving.

As soon as we returned with his birth certificates we took turns looking after Evan whilst the other got a good earned rest in bed. I found it very hard to sleep without Evan nearby, so my sleep was very broken with me continually waking because I missed him.

  <data name="y1w2Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm not exactly sure if week two was better or worse than the first week. It was nice that the visiting died down a bit and we were able to get used to a new life of three, but it was also hard dealing with Evans ever-increasing crying.  

It doesn't matter how many books you read, or what advice people give you, every baby is different. I kept reading how babies need to be calmed when they are crying by gentle rocking and speaking softly buy none of that worked with Evan. Quite the opposite in fact. I found that he seemed to like quite vigorous movement and the more he cried the more I'd have to bounce him around to stop him crying! One of the things we bought to help Emma with the labour was one of those exercise balls. Pacing around the room trying to bounce Evan around vigorously was very tiring so I tried just sitting on the ball and bouncing while holding him. To my amazement, it worked so that became my new baby-settling routine!  

Before we knew the sex of the baby I wanted a girl because I didn't really want to have to deal with "boys bits" :-) Now that he's here I wouldn't change him for the world of course but his little bits certainly do have a life of their own at changing time! I'm not sure how many times he's peed on me, or himself, or the carpet but I had the delights of being poo'd on this weekend! My best friend had come to stay and we were happily chatting away while I was changing Evan and suddenly his bottom just erupted and he squirted bright yellow poo all over my hand! Lovely :-)

    <value>After the recent evening events with Evan and his sleeping problems we decided it was probably best if Caroline moved downstairs to sleep on the futon. I was not very receptive to this suggestion but I do understand how much Caroline needs her sleep for University as she struggles to stay awake in lectures anyway!  

We had our first visit from the health visitor this week as we were no longer being cared for by the midwives. Evan certainly doesn't have a problem eating and breast feeding is going smoothly, this is reinforced by Evans continual weight gain, he now weighs in at 9lb 6oz.  

It's very difficult to tell but we are sure that Evan smiled at Caroline for the very first time this week. Most of the time, his smile-like look is an indication that he has wind but this week we saw a glimmer in his eyes and it wasn't the usual crooked smile.    

Another medical scare happened this week and it was just typical that it would be me to find it! Fortunately it was a Tuesday and Caroline was at home to hear my screams.. I was in the middle of changing Evan and I had a feeling his umbilical cord would fall off soon as it had started weeping. I could see through the vest that it had fallen off because something was stuck to the vest too far down to be his belly button so I was half prepared for something nasty. It was awful and no wonder change time had made Evan cry lately as his cord was sticking to his clothes and probably irritating him when we removed his clothes. The belly button looked all infected with lots of puss just sitting in his button hole. I cried out to Caroline as it didn't look right and in the end I had to get her to finish the change. I took him to the nurse that afternoon and she said it looked particularly nasty and warranted a second opinion as to what course of action to take. Poor little Evan ended up having it burnt with a nitrogen stick and he cried in the same way as he did when they did the Guthrie test on the heel of his foot. Luckily it only needed burning once and it went all black and dried up again a few days later. It took us a while to get his belly button all cleaned up properly and the poor little man had a few burn marks that needed to heal as well.  

Babies bring out smiles and kindness in everyone and that was evident this week. I find that whenever I am out with Evan, people always smile and have a passing look at him. Strangers just seem to smile all the time and they are more than happy to talk to you when you have a baby, especially one as cute as Evan! We were doing our weekly shop when the lady serving behind the deli counter had to stop serving customers to come and have a look at our beautiful son. We had a brief chat whilst being served but before we moved on she came from behind the counter to see Evan who was sleeping peacefully but still looking totally adorable. I could just stand and look at him for an eternity. Even the customers waiting didn't complain and I am sure the only reason they didn't was because of Evan :).</value>

    <value>Monday of this week was the end of my Christmas holiday and time for me to go back to Uni. Emma wasn't looking forward to it at all but thankfully my timetable is fairly light and as long as I'm able to study at home I don't have to be there all that much. One thing that did worry me though was the sleep I was getting. At night times it was taking 1-2 hours to get Evan off to sleep then I found that I kept waking up with his little kicks and fidgets. Then of course he'd wake up screaming several times a night needing a feed and the time it would take to feed him, change him and get him settled again is easily an hour or more. Even though Emma actually did all the work I found that I just couldn't sleep whilst all that was going on.  

I love Uni but I only enjoy it when I am alert enough to be able to concentrate. Plus some of my lecturers are dreadful and could send an insomniac-on-speed to sleep! A couple of days before going back I suggested to Emma that I would sleep downstairs on the futon. She wasn't too impressed but I think she knew deep down that I was going to do that. It's been a godsend! Even though I still wake up from Evan's crying because I'm in another part of the house I'm able to fall back to sleep again and as a result I've not been tired at all this week and my first week at Uni was fine. This was a huge relief because before he was born I had visions of falling asleep in all my lectures, not being able to concentrate, falling behind in my work etc so I'm really glad that it has worked out ok.  

This week I've been experimenting with new tricks to settle Evan when he's grizzly. Last week I'd already established that he likes movement and I had started bouncing on our exercise ball but sometimes that's not enough. We also discovered that he likes music, and not soft lullaby music but rock or dance music that's on MTV! 4.30 in the morning there I am in the middle of the lounge, MTV blaring, dancing away with a little baby in my arms! Thankfully it seems to do the trick within about 2 songs and he'll be fast asleep in my arms.  

This can get kinda tiring though so another thing we tried this week was to take him for a walk outside in the pram. The movement of it seems to settle him. The first time we tried this was around midnight one night when he'd been grizzling for hours and we no longer had the energy to dance. We wrapped him up nice and warm (screaming), put him in his pram and almost as soon as we stepped outside he stopped crying. Even though it was pretty cold it was nice. Emma and I had a chance to chat and we got some fresh air. We walked around our local neighbourhood for around half an hour.  

Unfortunately Evan's a clever boy and he seems to have some sixth sense when it comes to our attempts to put him down to sleep. Once we got back from our walk we gently brought the pram indoors, removed his blankets and left him in it for a while - at least, that was the plan. He lasted all of about 2 minutes before waking himself up and screaming all over again!</value>

    <value>I conquered one of my fears this week! I went to the mother and baby group to get Evan weighed and I also stayed for the session, which happened to be on sleep and routine! Routine?!? - Evan doesn't have one, so that's the next task to try and introduce, initially by going to bed at the same time every night and doing the same things to get him prepared for sleep time. Evan weighed in at 10lb 1oz and little chubby chops is starting to grow out of his vests. A pile of clothes that he is too big for has been started.  

This week I managed to get Evan off to sleep in the bed for a daytime nap. I was able to soothe him back to sleep when he woke himself up, even after having a nappy change. He even stayed in the room asleep afterwards on his own for a good period of time. In the past the moment you lay him down and attempt to leave him, he would start crying and be inconsolable. This appeared to be a one off event though as I learned at my mother and baby group that my earlier weeks of cuddling him to sleep were actually probably the cause for him not sleeping so well because when he stirs from light sleep still tired he doesn't know how to get himself back off to sleep and thus associates my cuddles and soothing / feeding as his way of sleeping. This isn't a problem at night time though, it must be because I am lying there next to him, but in the day I try to leave him to allow me to get other tasks done.  

Evan is starting to respond differently when he cries and we attend to him. Even just a gentle cuddle and rock, or even just stroking his hair and talking quietly to him is starting to be more effective. Jumping around to MTV is probably the last straw these days where as a week ago it was the only thing he liked.  

I've always found Evans facial expressions adorable and to help stimulate him we have been mimicking them as he does them. He has a wider range of facial expressions now and has even introduced some sounds into his repertoire. His sounds are these really cute "guuurrrrr" sounds and I respond with smiles and a similar sound.  

My mum has bought Evan an indoor swing to try and help us with the sleeping problems we are having. The swing can be put on a timer to swing, it plays music and we hopefully aide Evan when he stirs and help him get back to sleep. We'll find out next week if it works!  

All the sick events seem to involve me and Caroline gets lumbered with the poo events, I think I have the better of the two. A memorable moment of this week was noticing poo on Caroline's cheek. She didn't believe me at first, but she did when I started laughing so much it hurt my stomach. I am terrible for laughing at peoples misfortune, she ran to the kitchen sink as it was the closest and washed it off whilst chanting "Urggh Urggh Urrgggghhhh!". I can only assume that she must have brushed her hair out of her face with a pooey finger whilst in the midst of changing him :).</value>

  <data name="y1w4Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At last I'm starting to notice some real changes in Evan's behaviour now. In the beginning he was extremely insecure, we often had no clue why he would be crying and have a very hard time settling him. He was not very responsive at all. I have a couple of books about baby development and I read a little each week. Of course every baby is different but it was a little frustrating when he didn't seem to be exhibiting any of the behaviours I was reading about.  

But this past week we've had more success. We have a few brightly coloured toys and he'll now follow them with his eyes. We have a play gym which has a mirror on it and this week he started to take an interest in it. I don't think he knows who is there looking back at him but he'll focus on the mirror for quite a while now.  

He definitely spends more hours awake now. In the beginning he mostly slept but now he'll be awake for several hours during the day. The challenge is to keep him happy in those waking hours! His mood varies a lot and there's no real way to tell how he's going to react. Sometimes he'll amuse himself for quite a while, gurgling away but other times he'll start to scream the moment we put him down.  

He's now getting used to change time and bath time. Sometimes it seems like he actually likes being changed! Bath time is one of my favourite times, his little nekkid body is so cute! Another nice moment I had this week was being able to massage him properly for the first time. I have a book on Baby Massage and I've been trying to get him interested in it pretty much since birth but without success. But earlier this week I was changing him and he did a little pee (luckily I was able to mop it up quickly) so I figured that it was safe to leave his nappy off. He was quite happy and relaxed and I was able to massage him properly which was really nice. He felt so warm and soft afterwards. There's nothing quite like a baby's soft skin...</value>

    <value>Evan must have had a growth spurt recently, he put on 10 ounces this week when I weighed him at the Mother and Baby group. He weighs 10lb 11oz now and we started having issues with the nappies leaking so we decided to move him into the big boy nappies. We probably should have moved him up to the next size earlier to save us wasting nappies but I wasn't aware that the weights overlapped and I was trying to wait until Evan was 11lbs before moving onto the next!  

The swing that my mum bought for us last week works! It's a blessing, I can now pee in peace without a screaming baby in the next room, I can even get up and get myself a drink without worrying that Evan will cry. He seems to be very content in it, he'll eventually get bored but then he does with everything, his favourite toy is still me at the moment :).  

The routine enforcing isn't going to plan but we are slowly getting there. He still seems to spend all his time with us though he is managing to stay awake for longer and also keeping himself amused. This is proving useful as now I can at most meal times eat without having to tend to him several times throughout the meal. We are not having much success with taking him upstairs for his nap/sleep, but we are persevering. This is partly down to me I guess because sometimes I just want to hold him all the time and having him sleep on my chest is the best feeling in the world. I love that closeness, to feel his breathing and movements. I can stroke and kiss him whenever I want when he sleeps on me and I can check on him whenever he makes a sound that concerns me.  

He loves interactions with us and he is starting to really like change time. I can lie him on the mat after the nappy change and just play with him for ages. He will gurgle and smile at me when I play with his hands and feet whilst making noises and pulling faces. It's so much fun for us both!</value>

    <value>On Tuesday Emma had an appointment at the Dentist so I had Evan on my own. This was only the second time since his birth that Emma had been away from him for any length of time. Of course, he grizzled lots! I decided to take him for our usual walk as that has always settled him but this time it was not to be. He was really screaming and in my flap I just forgot everything - his hat, a muslin, mitts! So he was probably cold. To my embarrassment he just screamed all the way around the housing estate! He did finally settle a little but it was rather a traumatic walk!  

We've finally had to stop using his first set of vests. It's such a shame because we have a set that's really cute. I was able to use them for longer than Emma; for some reason she panics that she's breaking his arms when she's dressing him! Evan is also starting to lose his baby hair :-( He's thinning on top like an old man who's hairline is receding.   

A funny little incident that we had this week was while Emma was changing Evan. The phone rang and it was for her so I handed her the phone. I think it was the hospital calling about an appointment. Suddenly Evan just let rip this incredibly loud fart! I burst out laughing and had to quickly exit the room. Emma tried not to laugh as did the lady on the other end of the phone! It's quite amazing that this month-old baby can produce such loud burps and farts! We're training him well :D</value>

  <data name="y1w6One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I have finally started to feel much better now, the mother of all periods has gone and everything appears to have healed. My mum took me for my hospital scan this week and Evan had his first ride in a lift, he pulled his funny little face that he does when he's about to have a whiney cry and I was thinking oh god not in here. My mum just looked at him and said something like "You can stop that right now!" and to my surprise he did. Do you think I have that effect on him?!?!  

That day Evan got to visit his Great Grandmother who is 90 years his elder. I am not sure how much she was actually able to see of him because she was struggling to hear what I was saying and she's also going blind. She thought he was very small, which made me laugh because he's a big growing boy now weighing 11lb 4oz.  

I have been trying to find ways to get back into shape these last couple of weeks as I am bored of doing the basic pelvic floor and stomach clenches to strengthen those muscles. I was a fairly active person before pregnancy and because of my breastfeeding I cannot return to playing football and running until after this period as it is painful when I run with 38DD boobs. Evan is a very demanding baby and doing normal exercise is out of the question because he won't let me put him down for longer than 5 minutes at this age and I really want to stop feeling frumpy so I had to find an alternative way to exercise. I had been doing really well at hiding it until last weekend when Caroline spotted me one evening doing this odd looking dance to MTV with a baby in my arms. I wasn't dancing, I was inventing ways to exercise my major muscle groups and to keep my heart rate up whilst holding Evan carefully to my chest. He didn't mind at all because to him it just felt like I was doing a little jig to rock him to sleep as he loves MTV.  

As Caroline mentioned above, my first attempt at expressing milk resulted in only 2 ounces and it was a rather painful experience. I have been told by other mums that it gets easier and the more you do it, the more milk you can express so I'll certainly be trying that again even if it's only to help me in the evening when I feel like my boobs are totally drained and he still wants feeding. It was amazing to watch the milk expressing, it sprays out of several holes and it looked really funny. Now I know how those poor cows feel :).  

Oh and finally to Caroline's amusement Evan decided to spare her this week and instead poo'd all over my hand, it was nasty and warm!</value>

  <data name="y1w6Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Emma has been exclusively breast-feeding Evan since birth but sometimes she needs to go out somewhere where she can't take him along. When that happens she has to try to get him fed before she goes and get back quick as he's still feeding pretty much every two hours!  

So this week she thought she'd try expressing so we could try a bottle feed. I'll let Emma go into details about the expressing :-) Well a couple of days later we had a couple of ounces of milk (!) and we tried it out - he seemed to love it! He had no problems taking the bottle at all. Just one slight hitch - he went through those two ounces in about 5 minutes and he usually feeds for at least 15 minutes! So we looked up how much he should be taking at his age and sure enough its about 8 ounces per feed! Though probably a bit less for him as he still feeds very often.  

Even still, the expressing was so slow that we thought we'd try some formula instead. We bought a couple of cartons of the instant stuff so we didn't have to buy a whole tub in case it didn't work out. Just as well - he hated it! I tried it myself and it was like liquid chalk - yuukkk!! It's a shame really as it was nice to do a feed myself but hopefully she'll be able to try the expressing again with some more success.</value>

    <value>My little boy is growing so much, he has outgrown most of his baby clothes and me being a naughty mummy have spent all of his toys and clothes monthly allowance for the next 2 months already and it wasn't on the clothes we needed! He is looking so much older and definitely doesn't look like a new born anymore. He weighed 11lb 12oz this week which is a great weight so even though at times I feel like my boobs are drained and not satisfying him, he is certainly gaining the weight that he needs.  

This week Evan had a visit from his other Great Grandmother who lives up North. She was surprised at how much of a little wriggle pot Evan is. He is a really active baby and I actually think he gets frustrated because he can't move much. His favourite position is being held upright and even then you need good reflexes and hand movements because he can move his heavy head really quickly but with little stability.  

My time at home caring for Evan is flying by and I am enjoying it immensely. It can be a strain and very tiring at times but on the other hand it truly is rewarding when I see him all day long developing. I have changed emotionally whilst being at home with Evan and over the last week or so I have started having doubts about returning to work. When I think about leaving Evan to go to work and worse, having to send him to an expensive nursery, it fills me with sadness. I am his mum and I want to be his care person, I want to be there when he takes those first steps and speaks his first words, not some stranger. With Caroline being at University full time I had planned to return to work after 6 months. At that time though I wasn't aware of the changes that Evan would bring out in me and now I have presented myself with the biggest and most important challenge I have faced to date - How I could become a stay-at-home super mum!  

A special moment I had with Evan this week was in front of the mirror. For several days I have been putting him in front of the mirror to see if he recognises himself. This week I held him in my arms and he did indeed smile at himself, it was lovely and epitomized my reasons for wanting to be at home with Evan on a permanent basis.</value>

    <value>The things we do to placate our babies... One morning in the week Emma had had a rough night and was really tired so I took Evan in the front carrier so she could get some undisturbed sleep. We were milling around the house quite happily and I got peckish so I went to get myself some cereal and went back upstairs to do some stuff at the computer. Evan had other ideas :/ He started to cry so I stood up and jigged him a bit. It still didn't work so I turned on Avril Lavigne and jigged a bit more. In the meantime my cereal was getting soggy and I hate soggy cereal so I picked it up and attempted to eat it whilst still jigging!  

As if that was not enough, Cleo (the cat for those who don't know) decided that she wanted a bit of my cereal too. She jumped on the desk and started trying to climb up me. So there I was jigging up and down to Avril Lavigne with a baby bouncing around on my chest, a bowl of soggy cereal in one hand and a cat's head in the other! I'm glad the blinds were closed that morning! I also managed to bonk Evan on the head a couple of times with the cereal bowl, but don't tell Emma :-D And after all that my cereal was so soggy that I gave it to Cleo anyway :-(  

I had another go at bottle feeding this week. He didn't like the formula that we tried last week (SMA Gold) so Emma expressed some milk. She got the hang of it this time and managed to express about 5 ounces. The really cute thing was that he seemed to hold the bottle in his hands! He hasn't actually showed any signs of grasping at things with open hands yet but he held his fists up to the sides of the bottle and held it there throughout the feed.  

It was a week for grannies this week. Emma's gran came to visit and at the weekend we went to visit my mum who lives about 70 miles away. It was the first time my mum had seen him since a few days after the birth so she noticed how much he'd grown and changed! He had lots of smiles for her which was nice.</value>

  <data name="y1w8One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We have found a formula milk that Evan will drink (we hope it wasn't a one off) and he quite easily drank 8oz. It's nice for Caroline to have some bonding time with Evan and it really is lovely watching him feed with those gorgeous little eyes looking up at you. I don't always have expressed breast milk at hand and sometimes I feel like my boobs have nothing in them so having formula available will be very handy. It's especially useful for when we go to visit friends because it can be terribly lonely having to go to another room to feed Evan and it can take a long time and not having any support for my back is bad so having formula available for those trips will be great. The one downside with mixing breastfeeding with formula feeding is that it confuses my milk production and I usually get really engorged the following day :(.  

We took Evan for his first trip into our local town this week and because it was bitterly cold we had to put him in his coat. This coat even though it is a 0-3 month size it actually swamps the poor little guy. It comes down to his ankles and he couldn't really move his arms. He did look cute in a funny kind of way :). We introduced him to our hairdresser who absolutely loves babies and they all said he looks like me. I can't really see it but he does pull the same expressions that I do!  

I have booked myself a place on a baby massage class that will be running for 4 weeks in March so look out for updates on how that goes. It is a free class run by my local health visitor and it will be another trip out of the house for us and a chance for me to bond even more with Evan.  

Evan is very clingy and I am still struggling to get him to sleep or even lie down on his own in the day time. I have had to leave him to cry several times this week because I can't do everything with him in my arms and he really gets distressed when I try to use the front carrier. This week I tried to use it and we became stuck! I had him screaming in my ears and I was getting a little stressed too, but after a few minutes I managed to get the harness unclipped. I am running out of ideas to try to get Evan to sleep without me being his permanent mattress so I plan to mention it at his 8 week check with the Doctor next week.  

On a final note, here's some Valentine's Day humour. Whilst Caroline was on the telephone ordering our Indian takeaway treat Evan decide to do a massive adult sounding fart. I don't know how he does it, but he always manages to let one go at these inopportune moments! Caroline was unable to contain herself and all three of us (the guy on the telephone included) laughed out loud but he must have thought it was her and not our little angel of 7+ weeks old.</value>

    <value>Have you ever noticed how much conflicting advice is banded around about babies? And the more you read and the more people you talk to the more confusion there is. Evan is almost 2 months old now and he still can't get himself to sleep. 9 times out of 10 the only way we'll get him asleep is to let him fall asleep after a feed, on our chests, or in our arms to music. If he's fast asleep then we can put him down to bed and sometimes he'll stay asleep for a while - but usually he wakes within a few minutes. What we can't seem to do is to put him down when he's sleepy but still awake. He won't fall asleep. Instead he'll just cry and the crying will soon escalate into a full on scream.  

Half of the advice says that he's learned that if he cries that someone will come and pick him up and the only way to encourage him to "unlearn" this fact is to be harsh and let him cry to break that association. The other half of the advice says that you should never leave a baby to cry and the more he is held when he cries the more secure he will become as he grows older. Both of us are of the opinion that it isn't good to let him cry but it can be very tiring for Emma having to hold him all the time. So we're really hoping that he'll grow out of it soon! I have visions of Emma having this 10-year old asleep on her chest! :-)  

One of the things that I've been doing with Evan since he was about 4 weeks old is giving him "tummy time" on a daily basis. Babies traditionally spend most of their time lying on their backs but of course they need to be on their front if they are ever to crawl. Tummy time has many benefits for a new baby. This is an excerpt from the book "Baby Massage by Peter Walker"  

_**Regular waking time spent belly down ensures the structural health and fitness of his body in a way no other natural position can achieve. When your baby lies on his belly, he lifts his head to look around him - strengthening the supporting muscles in his neck. Once he has comfortably reached this stage, he will then lift his head and shoulders, developing strength in his arms and shoulders and flexibility in his spine.**_

_**Having achieved this, he will then raise his head and shoulders even further. This stretches open your baby's chest so that he achieves a deeper breathing rhythm and maximises his lung capacity. And as his chest stretches open, so too does his abdominal cavity - aiding digestion.**_  

So far Evan can lift his head and look around and sometimes he'll lift his shoulders up and prop himself up a bit. A couple of days ago he learned a new trick - he managed to roll over onto his back again!</value>
