    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>My experience of the birth is totally different to that of Caroline's. When I think back, parts of it are now starting to blur and I need reminding from those that were present to relive certain events. I guess the pain relief through drugs and that of my natural pain relief are part of the reasons for me not remembering it. I personally handled being pregnant and going through the labour better than I would have handled being the partner who felt completely helpless at times.
    
For two days I was having contractions and I really thought I was doing really well to have lasted with just the TENs machine. I wasn't at the time aware that my waters hadn't fully broken. When I was examined on Christmas Day and the midwife told me that I hadn't dilated at all I was devastated. All I could think of was that the pain I was having was obviously going to get worse. I have never been one for doing things the simple way and literally an hour after contacting my mum to tell her that she was unlikely to get the phone call to get in the car, I started having a contraction that felt just like all the others. I started to puff on the entonox and something inside went pop and all I felt was this gush. I remember hobbling to the toilet in my room shouting back to Caroline to get a midwife quick. When the midwife glanced down and saw the meconium she calmly said that I needed to get to the labour ward as one way or another this baby was going to be delivered. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, to suddenly go from being told that I was probably going to have to be induced the next morning to then having this happen was just typical of me, but I was happy that the baby had finally decided to come.  

This is when things start to go a little hazy for me. Caroline contacted my mum to tell her to make her way to the hospital. My birth plan went out the window because I originally wanted an active labour and also wanted to avoid having an epidural. I had to be monitored throughout the whole labour to make sure that the baby didn't go into distress because of the meconium. The induction drip was causing my contractions to become stronger and the pethidine and entonox were not being much help at this stage. I finally agreed to have the epidural and the anaesthetist was really good, she administered the epidural really quickly allaying all my fears of the procedure. The epidural only worked on one side of my body so I needed another dose, which caused my right side to get too much. It was quite funny when my leg kept falling off the bed and I had to ask people to pull my leg back up onto the bed. I don't recall much pain after this, I was finally able to doze off *(even mid-way through conversation)*. I'd only had 3 hours sleep over the past few days and it was all finally starting to take its toll on me.  

Thinking back to when the midwife went to lunch, I started to feel intense aching pains in my left buttock. It felt like the worst dead leg feeling you could imagine, everyone thought it was really funny and in the end I had my epidural topped up because it was hurting continuously. I can only assume that this was me feeling the contractions as the baby moved down on his own because when I was reexamined upon the midwifes return from her break, she encountered the baby's head. I couldn't believe my ears, this labour had suddenly gone from doing nothing to everything happening. I was so pleased because I was worried it would go to a c-section, which was not what I wanted. We had a few trial pushes and then waited 40 minutes for the epidural to wear off some more.  

The pushing stage was surreal, sometimes I couldn't feel the contractions and pleaded with the midwife to tell me when to push. She was brilliant and I don't think I will ever forget her. If things ever got a little scary, she never let on and remained completely calm. It was all hands on with my mum, Caroline and the midwife all helping me to push. I wish I could have seen what was happening, but then maybe that would have stressed me out. The cord around the neck was my worst fear throughout pregnancy and when it turned into reality I became a little hysterical. I was told to stop pushing and that is easier said than done! and the cutting of the cord seemed like a life time. When Caroline started to cry I feared the worst, but hearing his tender cry after I pushed his body put turned my tears into happy tears. Watching the medical staff clearing his air ways was awful, it looked such a painful procedure. Hearing his hearty cry afterwards made me feel over the moon.  

I don't remember much after that, I was absolutely drained physically and emotionally. It was a long time before I was able to hold my son and I really wanted us to bond straight away. When I finally held him for the first time, I was besotted, it was all worth it.  

Things I will never forget... The relief I felt inside when the placenta was delivered, it felt like I had just lost a couple of stone. Being sick, I was sick several times and managed to do so on everyone including the machine that I was hooked up to! The feeling of complete happiness I felt when I held my son for the first time. The amazing people that were with me throughout my delivery and hospital care. If only I could have the same people there for number two!</value>

    <value>Watching your loved one go through the pain of labour when there is virtually nothing you can do to alleviate her pain is heart-wrenching. As the labour drags on and on sapping every ounce of her energy and Christmas Day fades into Boxing day it's hard to imagine that this little baby will ever actually be born...  
    
The first signs of labour started early on the morning of Christmas Eve. Emma's waters appeared to break so she phoned the hospital and they advised her to come in due to risk of infection. The problem with this is that she had to go through all the first stage of labour in the discomfort of a hospital ward which is not what we wanted. The labour continued for what seemed like forever, including the whole of Christmas Day.  

At around 7pm on Christmas Day Emma had a contraction that didn't feel right. *"Something just went pop!"*, she said! Her waters had already broken but this time there was a lot more. Unfortunately it was green coloured which indicated that Evan had poo'd inside of the womb. The first poo consists of something called meconium which is green. This can be dangerous for the baby if he ingested it so Emma was taken down to the labour ward to be induced. Even though we were a little worried about this meconium it was reassuring to know that this labour was really going to get underway!  

The contractions got stronger, closer together and more painful but there was still no real progress - no dilation, despite the induction. Christmas Day passed and still nothing. Shortly after midnight the midwife examined Emma again and found her to be dilated to a fingertip :/ She went off for her break at about 1am and said she'd re-examine Emma again upon her return and if there was still no progress she'd discuss our options with the Doctor. I heard them mention the C word *(caesarean)* which we were rather afraid of.  

However, when examined again shortly before 3am we were all amazed to hear the words *"Hello Baby!"*. Emma was fully dilated and the head was moving down. Great news, at last! No C-Section necessary. We waited a little while longer firstly to allow the baby to travel down further on his own to reduce the need for so much pushing and secondly to allow the effects of the epidural to wear off a little more so that Emma would be able to feel the sensations of the contractions so she'd know when to push.  

The pushing started at 3.45 and the midwife and I both stood on one side of Emma as supports for her legs to give her a bit of help! By 4.05am Evan was born but those 20 minutes were the most emotional of my life. I had so many different emotions running through my head at a time that I found it hard to cope. Watching Emma going through all that pain was unbearable and as Evan's head began to emerge I felt an incredible sense of fear that something was wrong as he was such a strange colour. *(No amount of birthing TV shows and photos in magazines helped with the shock of the real thing!)* The fear was made worse when the midwife shouted that his cord was around his neck! Thankfully it took them just a moment to snip off the cord and he was out in one more push but it was still incredibly frightening, exciting, and overwhelming all at the same time.  

It's an experience I will never forget and with this diary I hope that I'll never forget any of the experiences that are to come as Evan develops and grows up...</value>

  <data name="y1w1One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My recollection of days and times became completely muddled after the birth of Evan. I was wheeled up to the postnatal ward at 7am in the morning and because we then went to bed it actually feels like I was in hospital for a day longer than I actually was. I didn't get much sleep at all and 2 hours later I woke up feeling terrible. My right leg was still completely dead and I couldn't move at all. When Evan started to cry I couldn't tend to him because of my problems with the epidural and I didn't have a nurses buzzer at the bedside either. In a panic I remember asking one of the other patients to press her buzzer for me, we had language difficulties though as she knew very little English. Instead she pressed the emergency alarm and about 10 nurses arrived at our beds less than a minute later. My nurses buzzer was fixed shortly after that incident. That first morning dragged on, I now had Evan in my arms and we just lay on the bed waiting for Caroline to arrive. I waited for as long as I could before requesting assistance from the nurses to help me and my one working leg to the toilet, I was hoping Caroline would have made it in because it would have been more dignifying having her help me. My leg felt strange as the feeling very slowly returned, I could touch my leg and feel the sensation of touch but I couldn't feel it directly underneath my fingertip. I was glad when the full sensations finally returned later on in the evening, I was beginning to wonder if it would ever return!  
    
Evan was very quiet in hospital, he hardly ever cried. Caroline looked great with him and she did all the mucky stuff while I just rested and relaxed. I think I only changed the nappies at night time when she wasn't around! The nurses were absolutely fantastic in hospital and it was really nice knowing that there was someone who knew what they were doing on the end of the buzzer. I didn't realise how much I missed them and the security of having them around until we finally went home the following evening. I remember waking up in the middle of the night following Evans birth for a feed and nappy change only to find that Evan's right eye was stuck together *(known as sticky eye)*. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't get him to open it and I panicked. The nurses were great though, they bathed it and showed me what to do if it happened again and I was very glad that they were there.  

The hormones definitely play havoc with your system, I found that once we had left the security of the hospital environment and were now at home alone with the task of being parents, things really started to sink in and I did experience the baby blues for several days. I'd walk into a room and Caroline would see me crying and I couldn't tell her why. It's a really strange feeling, the simplest of things can just set you off. I found that the feeling of uncertainty and not knowing if I could cope without the help from the nurses would easily start the tears for me.  

I was surprised by the amount of visitors we had, almost everyday we had someone new wanting to see Evan or a delivery at the door with presents for him. It's amazing the effect babies have on people, some of the visitors had never even seen our house and that was 3 years on from when we moved in! Before the birth I speculated on how many visitors we would get because we don't have a very big circle of friends and our families aren't really that close that we see each other often, however I was quietly surprised by the amount of people that did come to welcome Evan into the world.  

We still had the visits from the community midwife to make sure that we were coping and recovering well after the birth so it was nice to know that we were only a day or two away from a health professional if we needed some advice. I was expecting Evan to lose a fair amount of weight after the birth and the midwife even told us that if he did then it was nothing to be worried about. To our surprise our little 8lb 10 baby weighed in at 8lb 8 when the midwife weighed him. Her comments following the weighing were *"Well we can certainly see that you are not having problems breast feeding!"* That's my boy, he certainly likes his food and he is a real guzzler too.  

We only had the one scare in the first week, I managed to give Evan a little bit of diarrhea after taking some lactulose to help me go to the toilet for the first time since the birth 3 days previous. The contents of his nappy turned green and stringy one night and I stupidly assumed that that was the Chinese seaweed that I had eaten earlier passing through to him. I can't believe I actually said that at the time and Caroline just laughed at me and posed the question *"How can seaweed turn into milk and then somehow turn back into seaweed inside him?"*. Yes yes, it's the hormones! We actually telephoned NHS Direct that night to see if it was anything to be worried about as we had already had all the varying different coloured poo and was not expecting it to go back to green after the mustard coloured. It wasn't anything to worry about and we were just being typical new first time parents, getting worried over absolutely everything.  

Things that I'll never forget about the first week... The few nights that Evan slept really well, being able to just sit on the sofa with him lying beside me looking absolutely adorable. In that first week I felt completely contented just sitting down cuddling him while he slept peacefully in my arms. Enjoy those moments while you can because life finally has to speed up again and get back to normal.</value>

  <data name="y1w1Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Emma and Evan were taken up to the postnatal ward at about 7am and we were all thoroughly exhausted. Her mum and I waited until they were both settled and then went home for some well-earned sleep! The drive home was weird. It was about -3 outside and the car was frozen solid. To me it was the end of a very long night but in reality the day was just starting. As I started to drive the emotion of it all really hit me and I had tears streaming down my face all the way home. I slumped into bed and managed to get about 3 hours sleep...  
    
Going back into hospital that afternoon was equally weird as it felt like the next day. I was so tired that I almost crashed on one of the roundabouts on the way in! I remember thinking to myself that the next time I would see Evan he'd be about twice the age he was when I last saw him! Of course, that's only a few hours but I was worried that he'd have changed completely and I wouldn't recognise him.  

The midwife had phoned me at home just before I left the house saying that Emma had been asking for me so I envisaged walking in to a bedraggled girlfriend and a screaming baby! I was pleasantly surprised to see Emma sitting up in bed with Evan fast asleep and sprawled out before her on the bed. I just had to take a photo and it's one of my favourites of the early ones.  

Shortly after getting to the hospital I was faced with my first dirty nappy. You know, I had actually completely forgotten that babies needed nappy changing *(doh!)* It was pretty mucky *(and I took a photo of it too!)* but I didn't mind at all, it was actually kinda cute! I felt a bit intimidated though having to change my first nappy in front of the midwife and I also felt very awkward handling him.  

The next few hours I remember spending ages just looking at Evan, trying to *"learn"* his face. By the following day I had also started to learn his voice and if I was out in the corridor I was able to distinguish his cries from that of the other babies.  

I was really worried about coming home with Evan because we have three cats and we were quite apprehensive about their behaviour towards him. We anticipated that Treacle would be so scared of this noisy thing that she'd spend 6 months hiding under the bed, Poppy would probably hiss at him lots and Cleo, once she figured that he wasn't edible, would just lose interest. We were right about Cleo but Poppy is quite the opposite. She loves to be around him and when he cries she perks up, walks right over to him and gives him a good sniff. She also guards the door when he's in the bedroom on his own and meows to go in there, little cutie. Treacle is being remarkably brave *(she's an incredibly scatty cat!)* and she's quite a sight to watch as she tip-paws up to him, has a tentative sniff and then jumps out of her fur and bolts at the slightest sniffle! Anyway there's no hissing so we're pleased.  

All the visitors we had in the first week were rather disconcerting. They were mostly Emma's relatives and seeing as Evan isn't biologically related to me I can't help but feeling like a bit of an outsider. I'm hoping that feeling will pass with time. For now I've just been playing host, making everybody cups of tea and letting them pass him around like a new toy.  

Our first trip outside of the house was a bit of an adventure! We figured we'd go to Mothercare as that's a nice *"safe"* environment to take a baby and if he cried it wouldn't be as embarrassing as it would be in the local supermarket. Well, that was the theory anyway. After struggling with the pushchair for ages we finally made it into the shop. Emma had to go off and get measured for a nursing bra so I was left with Evan hanging out in the underwear section! My worst fears were realised when he started to cry, then howl, and finally scream! I picked him up rather awkwardly and tried my best to hide behind the huge disposable knickers! It seemed like an age before Emma came back and I just handed him straight back to her - *"your baby!"*. Naughty I know :-)</value>

  <data name="y1w2One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After the crazy hectic first week at home, most people we knew had managed to see Evan and the daily visits had died down. I had been warned in pregnancy to expect my washing machine to be busy and I am starting to see that now. On average we are doing 2 loads a day when before having Evan I'd only have the washing machine on 3 times a week! I just hope my washing machine survives the extra workload as even before Evan I noticed it was starting to groan lots.  

The long hard nights started this week and Evan was becoming as regular as clockwork with his *"rattyness"* starting around 7pm. We'd struggle to settle him for most of the evening, bed time being the hardest. It doesn't help that he really dislikes lying on his back, his favourite position being upright against my chest with his head nuzzled under my chin.   

This year was the very first time that we spent Christmas at home together in 7 years. Usually we are at either mine or Caroline's mums house but seeing as I was heavily pregnant, we decided to stay at home. We were hoping Evan would arrive early and then we could have a Christmas dinner with him so we stocked up on everything, turkey, vegetables and we even planned to make a nice Christmas dessert. All of this ended up in the bin when we returned home from hospital but we weren't to be deterred. We bought a new turkey and Caroline cooked us our Christmas dinner this week. It was lovely and I'll never forget how funny it looked when Caroline was trying to rinse out this huge turkey in the sink, holding its legs in the air. I found it incredibly hilarious that I filmed it on the camcorder, unfortunately I didn't take any static photos of this particular event.  

We had an early appointment this week to get Evan registered and of all the nights where we really needed our sleep was the night before this day. We could not get Evan settled at all, he cried so much it made me cry too. We tried rocking, singing and cuddling but none of this would settle him at all. We were really concerned that something was seriously wrong with him and this night we called the labour ward for advice. I had to take the call in another room and the midwife could still hear him crying. She put it down to a bit of colic and said that we needed to stay strong, give him a bath and to maybe put him on the boob every time he became distressed to calm him. The feeding turned out to help hugely, though it was really rough for me and my boobs. We took it in turns to pace the room cuddling him as well as the feeding trick. We managed to get around 3 hours sleep that night and amazingly we were able to get up, washed and dressed in time to leave the house at 9am. I think Evan and I slept in the car, but poor Caroline had to do the driving.

As soon as we returned with his birth certificates we took turns looking after Evan whilst the other got a good earned rest in bed. I found it very hard to sleep without Evan nearby, so my sleep was very broken with me continually waking because I missed him.

  <data name="y1w2Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm not exactly sure if week two was better or worse than the first week. It was nice that the visiting died down a bit and we were able to get used to a new life of three, but it was also hard dealing with Evans ever-increasing crying.  

It doesn't matter how many books you read, or what advice people give you, every baby is different. I kept reading how babies need to be calmed when they are crying by gentle rocking and speaking softly buy none of that worked with Evan. Quite the opposite in fact. I found that he seemed to like quite vigorous movement and the more he cried the more I'd have to bounce him around to stop him crying! One of the things we bought to help Emma with the labour was one of those exercise balls. Pacing around the room trying to bounce Evan around vigorously was very tiring so I tried just sitting on the ball and bouncing while holding him. To my amazement, it worked so that became my new baby-settling routine!  

Before we knew the sex of the baby I wanted a girl because I didn't really want to have to deal with *"boys bits"* :-) Now that he's here I wouldn't change him for the world of course but his little bits certainly do have a life of their own at changing time! I'm not sure how many times he's peed on me, or himself, or the carpet but I had the delights of being poo'd on this weekend! My best friend had come to stay and we were happily chatting away while I was changing Evan and suddenly his bottom just erupted and he squirted bright yellow poo all over my hand! Lovely :-)

    <value>After the recent evening events with Evan and his sleeping problems we decided it was probably best if Caroline moved downstairs to sleep on the futon. I was not very receptive to this suggestion but I do understand how much Caroline needs her sleep for University as she struggles to stay awake in lectures anyway!  

We had our first visit from the health visitor this week as we were no longer being cared for by the midwives. Evan certainly doesn't have a problem eating and breast feeding is going smoothly, this is reinforced by Evans continual weight gain, he now weighs in at 9lb 6oz.  

It's very difficult to tell but we are sure that Evan smiled at Caroline for the very first time this week. Most of the time, his smile-like look is an indication that he has wind but this week we saw a glimmer in his eyes and it wasn't the usual crooked smile.    

Another medical scare happened this week and it was just typical that it would be me to find it! Fortunately it was a Tuesday and Caroline was at home to hear my screams.. I was in the middle of changing Evan and I had a feeling his umbilical cord would fall off soon as it had started weeping. I could see through the vest that it had fallen off because something was stuck to the vest too far down to be his belly button so I was half prepared for something nasty. It was awful and no wonder change time had made Evan cry lately as his cord was sticking to his clothes and probably irritating him when we removed his clothes. The belly button looked all infected with lots of puss just sitting in his button hole. I cried out to Caroline as it didn't look right and in the end I had to get her to finish the change. I took him to the nurse that afternoon and she said it looked particularly nasty and warranted a second opinion as to what course of action to take. Poor little Evan ended up having it burnt with a nitrogen stick and he cried in the same way as he did when they did the Guthrie test on the heel of his foot. Luckily it only needed burning once and it went all black and dried up again a few days later. It took us a while to get his belly button all cleaned up properly and the poor little man had a few burn marks that needed to heal as well.  

Babies bring out smiles and kindness in everyone and that was evident this week. I find that whenever I am out with Evan, people always smile and have a passing look at him. Strangers just seem to smile all the time and they are more than happy to talk to you when you have a baby, especially one as cute as Evan! We were doing our weekly shop when the lady serving behind the deli counter had to stop serving customers to come and have a look at our beautiful son. We had a brief chat whilst being served but before we moved on she came from behind the counter to see Evan who was sleeping peacefully but still looking totally adorable. I could just stand and look at him for an eternity. Even the customers waiting didn't complain and I am sure the only reason they didn't was because of Evan :).</value>

    <value>Monday of this week was the end of my Christmas holiday and time for me to go back to Uni. Emma wasn't looking forward to it at all but thankfully my timetable is fairly light and as long as I'm able to study at home I don't have to be there all that much. One thing that did worry me though was the sleep I was getting. At night times it was taking 1-2 hours to get Evan off to sleep then I found that I kept waking up with his little kicks and fidgets. Then of course he'd wake up screaming several times a night needing a feed and the time it would take to feed him, change him and get him settled again is easily an hour or more. Even though Emma actually did all the work I found that I just couldn't sleep whilst all that was going on.  

I love Uni but I only enjoy it when I am alert enough to be able to concentrate. Plus some of my lecturers are dreadful and could send an insomniac-on-speed to sleep! A couple of days before going back I suggested to Emma that I would sleep downstairs on the futon. She wasn't too impressed but I think she knew deep down that I was going to do that. It's been a godsend! Even though I still wake up from Evan's crying because I'm in another part of the house I'm able to fall back to sleep again and as a result I've not been tired at all this week and my first week at Uni was fine. This was a huge relief because before he was born I had visions of falling asleep in all my lectures, not being able to concentrate, falling behind in my work etc so I'm really glad that it has worked out ok.  

This week I've been experimenting with new tricks to settle Evan when he's grizzly. Last week I'd already established that he likes movement and I had started bouncing on our exercise ball but sometimes that's not enough. We also discovered that he likes music, and not soft lullaby music but rock or dance music that's on MTV! 4.30 in the morning there I am in the middle of the lounge, MTV blaring, dancing away with a little baby in my arms! Thankfully it seems to do the trick within about 2 songs and he'll be fast asleep in my arms.  

This can get kinda tiring though so another thing we tried this week was to take him for a walk outside in the pram. The movement of it seems to settle him. The first time we tried this was around midnight one night when he'd been grizzling for hours and we no longer had the energy to dance. We wrapped him up nice and warm *(screaming)*, put him in his pram and almost as soon as we stepped outside he stopped crying. Even though it was pretty cold it was nice. Emma and I had a chance to chat and we got some fresh air. We walked around our local neighbourhood for around half an hour.  

Unfortunately Evan's a clever boy and he seems to have some sixth sense when it comes to our attempts to put him down to sleep. Once we got back from our walk we gently brought the pram indoors, removed his blankets and left him in it for a while - at least, that was the plan. He lasted all of about 2 minutes before waking himself up and screaming all over again!</value>

    <value>I conquered one of my fears this week! I went to the mother and baby group to get Evan weighed and I also stayed for the session, which happened to be on sleep and routine! Routine?!? - Evan doesn't have one, so that's the next task to try and introduce, initially by going to bed at the same time every night and doing the same things to get him prepared for sleep time. Evan weighed in at 10lb 1oz and little chubby chops is starting to grow out of his vests. A pile of clothes that he is too big for has been started.  

This week I managed to get Evan off to sleep in the bed for a daytime nap. I was able to soothe him back to sleep when he woke himself up, even after having a nappy change. He even stayed in the room asleep afterwards on his own for a good period of time. In the past the moment you lay him down and attempt to leave him, he would start crying and be inconsolable. This appeared to be a one off event though as I learned at my mother and baby group that my earlier weeks of cuddling him to sleep were actually probably the cause for him not sleeping so well because when he stirs from light sleep still tired he doesn't know how to get himself back off to sleep and thus associates my cuddles and soothing / feeding as his way of sleeping. This isn't a problem at night time though, it must be because I am lying there next to him, but in the day I try to leave him to allow me to get other tasks done.  

Evan is starting to respond differently when he cries and we attend to him. Even just a gentle cuddle and rock, or even just stroking his hair and talking quietly to him is starting to be more effective. Jumping around to MTV is probably the last straw these days where as a week ago it was the only thing he liked.  

I've always found Evans facial expressions adorable and to help stimulate him we have been mimicking them as he does them. He has a wider range of facial expressions now and has even introduced some sounds into his repertoire. His sounds are these really cute *"guuurrrrr"* sounds and I respond with smiles and a similar sound.  

My mum has bought Evan an indoor swing to try and help us with the sleeping problems we are having. The swing can be put on a timer to swing, it plays music and we hopefully aide Evan when he stirs and help him get back to sleep. We'll find out next week if it works!  

All the sick events seem to involve me and Caroline gets lumbered with the poo events, I think I have the better of the two. A memorable moment of this week was noticing poo on Caroline's cheek. She didn't believe me at first, but she did when I started laughing so much it hurt my stomach. I am terrible for laughing at peoples misfortune, she ran to the kitchen sink as it was the closest and washed it off whilst chanting *"Urggh Urggh Urrgggghhhh!"*. I can only assume that she must have brushed her hair out of her face with a pooey finger whilst in the midst of changing him :).</value>

  <data name="y1w4Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At last I'm starting to notice some real changes in Evan's behaviour now. In the beginning he was extremely insecure, we often had no clue why he would be crying and have a very hard time settling him. He was not very responsive at all. I have a couple of books about baby development and I read a little each week. Of course every baby is different but it was a little frustrating when he didn't seem to be exhibiting any of the behaviours I was reading about.  

But this past week we've had more success. We have a few brightly coloured toys and he'll now follow them with his eyes. We have a play gym which has a mirror on it and this week he started to take an interest in it. I don't think he knows who is there looking back at him but he'll focus on the mirror for quite a while now.  

He definitely spends more hours awake now. In the beginning he mostly slept but now he'll be awake for several hours during the day. The challenge is to keep him happy in those waking hours! His mood varies a lot and there's no real way to tell how he's going to react. Sometimes he'll amuse himself for quite a while, gurgling away but other times he'll start to scream the moment we put him down.  

He's now getting used to change time and bath time. Sometimes it seems like he actually likes being changed! Bath time is one of my favourite times, his little nekkid body is so cute! Another nice moment I had this week was being able to massage him properly for the first time. I have a book on baby massage and I've been trying to get him interested in it pretty much since birth but without success. But earlier this week I was changing him and he did a little wee *(luckily I was able to mop it up quickly)* so I figured that it was safe to leave his nappy off. He was quite happy and relaxed and I was able to massage him properly which was really nice. He felt so warm and soft afterwards. There's nothing quite like a baby's soft skin...</value>

    <value>Evan must have had a growth spurt recently, he put on 10 ounces this week when I weighed him at the Mother and Baby group. He weighs 10lb 11oz now and we started having issues with the nappies leaking so we decided to move him into the big boy nappies. We probably should have moved him up to the next size earlier to save us wasting nappies but I wasn't aware that the weights overlapped and I was trying to wait until Evan was 11lbs before moving onto the next!  

The swing that my mum bought for us last week works! It's a blessing, I can now pee in peace without a screaming baby in the next room, I can even get up and get myself a drink without worrying that Evan will cry. He seems to be very content in it, he'll eventually get bored but then he does with everything, his favourite toy is still me at the moment :).  

The routine enforcing isn't going to plan but we are slowly getting there. He still seems to spend all his time with us though he is managing to stay awake for longer and also keeping himself amused. This is proving useful as now I can at most meal times eat without having to tend to him several times throughout the meal. We are not having much success with taking him upstairs for his nap/sleep, but we are persevering. This is partly down to me I guess because sometimes I just want to hold him all the time and having him sleep on my chest is the best feeling in the world. I love that closeness, to feel his breathing and movements. I can stroke and kiss him whenever I want when he sleeps on me and I can check on him whenever he makes a sound that concerns me.  

He loves interactions with us and he is starting to really like change time. I can lie him on the mat after the nappy change and just play with him for ages. He will gurgle and smile at me when I play with his hands and feet whilst making noises and pulling faces. It's so much fun for us both!</value>

    <value>On Tuesday Emma had an appointment at the Dentist so I had Evan on my own. This was only the second time since his birth that Emma had been away from him for any length of time. Of course, he grizzled lots! I decided to take him for our usual walk as that has always settled him but this time it was not to be. He was really screaming and in my flap I just forgot everything - his hat, a muslin, mitts! So he was probably cold. To my embarrassment he just screamed all the way around the housing estate! He did finally settle a little but it was rather a traumatic walk!  

We've finally had to stop using his first set of vests. It's such a shame because we have a set that's really cute. I was able to use them for longer than Emma; for some reason she panics that she's breaking his arms when she's dressing him! Evan is also starting to lose his baby hair, he's thinning on top like an old man who's hairline is receding.   

A funny little incident that we had this week was while Emma was changing Evan. The phone rang and it was for her so I handed her the phone. I think it was the hospital calling about an appointment. Suddenly Evan just let rip this incredibly loud fart! I burst out laughing and had to quickly exit the room. Emma tried not to laugh as did the lady on the other end of the phone! It's quite amazing that this month-old baby can produce such loud burps and farts! We're training him well :D</value>

  <data name="y1w6One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I have finally started to feel much better now, the mother of all periods has gone and everything appears to have healed. My mum took me for my hospital scan this week and Evan had his first ride in a lift, he pulled his funny little face that he does when he's about to have a whiney cry and I was thinking oh god not in here. My mum just looked at him and said something like *"You can stop that right now!"* and to my surprise he did. Do you think I have that effect on him?!?!  

That day Evan got to visit his great grandmother who is 90 years his elder. I am not sure how much she was actually able to see of him because she was struggling to hear what I was saying and she's also going blind. She thought he was very small, which made me laugh because he's a big growing boy now weighing 11lb 4oz.  

I have been trying to find ways to get back into shape these last couple of weeks as I am bored of doing the basic pelvic floor and stomach clenches to strengthen those muscles. I was a fairly active person before pregnancy and because of my breastfeeding I cannot return to playing football and running until after this period as it is painful when I run with 38DD boobs. Evan is a very demanding baby and doing normal exercise is out of the question because he won't let me put him down for longer than 5 minutes at this age and I really want to stop feeling frumpy so I had to find an alternative way to exercise. I had been doing really well at hiding it until last weekend when Caroline spotted me one evening doing this odd looking dance to MTV with a baby in my arms. I wasn't dancing, I was inventing ways to exercise my major muscle groups and to keep my heart rate up whilst holding Evan carefully to my chest. He didn't mind at all because to him it just felt like I was doing a little jig to rock him to sleep as he loves MTV.  

As Caroline mentioned above, my first attempt at expressing milk resulted in only 2 ounces and it was a rather painful experience. I have been told by other mums that it gets easier and the more you do it, the more milk you can express so I'll certainly be trying that again even if it's only to help me in the evening when I feel like my boobs are totally drained and he still wants feeding. It was amazing to watch the milk expressing, it sprays out of several holes and it looked really funny. Now I know how those poor cows feel :).  

Oh and finally to Caroline's amusement Evan decided to spare her this week and instead poo'd all over my hand, it was nasty and warm!</value>

  <data name="y1w6Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Emma has been exclusively breast-feeding Evan since birth but sometimes she needs to go out somewhere where she can't take him along. When that happens she has to try to get him fed before she goes and get back quick as he's still feeding pretty much every two hours!  

So this week she thought she'd try expressing so we could try a bottle feed. I'll let Emma go into details about the expressing :-) Well a couple of days later we had a couple of ounces of milk **(!)** and we tried it out - he seemed to love it! He had no problems taking the bottle at all. Just one slight hitch - he went through those two ounces in about 5 minutes and he usually feeds for at least 15 minutes! So we looked up how much he should be taking at his age and sure enough its about 8 ounces per feed! Though probably a bit less for him as he still feeds very often.  

Even still, the expressing was so slow that we thought we'd try some formula instead. We bought a couple of cartons of the instant stuff so we didn't have to buy a whole tub in case it didn't work out. Just as well - he hated it! I tried it myself and it was like liquid chalk - yuukkk!! It's a shame really as it was nice to do a feed myself but hopefully she'll be able to try the expressing again with some more success.</value>

    <value>My little boy is growing so much, he has outgrown most of his baby clothes and me being a naughty mummy have spent all of his toys and clothes monthly allowance for the next 2 months already and it wasn't on the clothes we needed! He is looking so much older and definitely doesn't look like a new born anymore. He weighed 11lb 12oz this week which is a great weight so even though at times I feel like my boobs are drained and not satisfying him, he is certainly gaining the weight that he needs.  

This week Evan had a visit from his other great grandmother who lives up North. She was surprised at how much of a little wriggle pot Evan is. He is a really active baby and I actually think he gets frustrated because he can't move much. His favourite position is being held upright and even then you need good reflexes and hand movements because he can move his heavy head really quickly but with little stability.  

My time at home caring for Evan is flying by and I am enjoying it immensely. It can be a strain and very tiring at times but on the other hand it truly is rewarding when I see him all day long developing. I have changed emotionally whilst being at home with Evan and over the last week or so I have started having doubts about returning to work. When I think about leaving Evan to go to work and worse, having to send him to an expensive nursery, it fills me with sadness. I am his mum and I want to be his care person, I want to be there when he takes those first steps and speaks his first words, not some stranger. With Caroline being at University full time I had planned to return to work after 6 months. At that time though I wasn't aware of the changes that Evan would bring out in me and now I have presented myself with the biggest and most important challenge I have faced to date - How I could become a stay-at-home super mum!  

A special moment I had with Evan this week was in front of the mirror. For several days I have been putting him in front of the mirror to see if he recognises himself. This week I held him in my arms and he did indeed smile at himself, it was lovely and epitomized my reasons for wanting to be at home with Evan on a permanent basis.</value>

    <value>The things we do to placate our babies... One morning in the week Emma had had a rough night and was really tired so I took Evan in the front carrier so she could get some undisturbed sleep. We were milling around the house quite happily and I got peckish so I went to get myself some cereal and went back upstairs to do some stuff at the computer. Evan had other ideas :/ He started to cry so I stood up and jigged him a bit. It still didn't work so I turned on Avril Lavigne and jigged a bit more. In the meantime my cereal was getting soggy and I hate soggy cereal so I picked it up and attempted to eat it whilst still jigging!  

As if that was not enough, Cleo *(the cat for those who don't know)* decided that she wanted a bit of my cereal too. She jumped on the desk and started trying to climb up me. So there I was jigging up and down to Avril Lavigne with a baby bouncing around on my chest, a bowl of soggy cereal in one hand and a cat's head in the other! I'm glad the blinds were closed that morning! I also managed to bonk Evan on the head a couple of times with the cereal bowl, but don't tell Emma :-D And after all that my cereal was so soggy that I gave it to Cleo anyway.  

I had another go at bottle feeding this week. He didn't like the formula that we tried last week *(SMA Gold)* so Emma expressed some milk. She got the hang of it this time and managed to express about 5 ounces. The really cute thing was that he seemed to hold the bottle in his hands! He hasn't actually showed any signs of grasping at things with open hands yet but he held his fists up to the sides of the bottle and held it there throughout the feed.  

It was a week for grannies this week. Emma's gran came to visit and at the weekend we went to visit my mum who lives about 70 miles away. It was the first time my mum had seen him since a few days after the birth so she noticed how much he'd grown and changed! He had lots of smiles for her which was nice.</value>

  <data name="y1w8One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We have found a formula milk that Evan will drink *(we hope it wasn't a one off)* and he quite easily drank 8oz. It's nice for Caroline to have some bonding time with Evan and it really is lovely watching him feed with those gorgeous little eyes looking up at you. I don't always have expressed breast milk at hand and sometimes I feel like my boobs have nothing in them so having formula available will be very handy. It's especially useful for when we go to visit friends because it can be terribly lonely having to go to another room to feed Evan and it can take a long time and not having any support for my back is bad so having formula available for those trips will be great. The one downside with mixing breastfeeding with formula feeding is that it confuses my milk production and I usually get really engorged the following day :(.  

We took Evan for his first trip into our local town this week and because it was bitterly cold we had to put him in his coat. This coat even though it is a 0-3 month size it actually swamps the poor little guy. It comes down to his ankles and he couldn't really move his arms. He did look cute in a funny kind of way :). We introduced him to our hairdresser who absolutely loves babies and they all said he looks like me. I can't really see it but he does pull the same expressions that I do!  

I have booked myself a place on a baby massage class that will be running for 4 weeks in March so look out for updates on how that goes. It is a free class run by my local health visitor and it will be another trip out of the house for us and a chance for me to bond even more with Evan.  

Evan is very clingy and I am still struggling to get him to sleep or even lie down on his own in the day time. I have had to leave him to cry several times this week because I can't do everything with him in my arms and he really gets distressed when I try to use the front carrier. This week I tried to use it and we became stuck! I had him screaming in my ears and I was getting a little stressed too, but after a few minutes I managed to get the harness unclipped. I am running out of ideas to try to get Evan to sleep without me being his permanent mattress so I plan to mention it at his 8 week check with the Doctor next week.  

On a final note, here's some Valentine's Day humour. Whilst Caroline was on the telephone ordering our Indian takeaway treat Evan decide to do a massive adult sounding fart. I don't know how he does it, but he always manages to let one go at these inopportune moments! Caroline was unable to contain herself and all three of us *(the guy on the telephone included)* laughed out loud but he must have thought it was her and not our little angel of 7+ weeks old.</value>

    <value>Have you ever noticed how much conflicting advice is banded around about babies? And the more you read and the more people you talk to the more confusion there is. Evan is almost 2 months old now and he still can't get himself to sleep. 9 times out of 10 the only way we'll get him asleep is to let him fall asleep after a feed, on our chests, or in our arms to music. If he's fast asleep then we can put him down to bed and sometimes he'll stay asleep for a while - but usually he wakes within a few minutes. What we can't seem to do is to put him down when he's sleepy but still awake. He won't fall asleep. Instead he'll just cry and the crying will soon escalate into a full on scream.  

Half of the advice says that he's learned that if he cries that someone will come and pick him up and the only way to encourage him to "unlearn" this fact is to be harsh and let him cry to break that association. The other half of the advice says that you should never leave a baby to cry and the more he is held when he cries the more secure he will become as he grows older. Both of us are of the opinion that it isn't good to let him cry but it can be very tiring for Emma having to hold him all the time. So we're really hoping that he'll grow out of it soon! I have visions of Emma having this 10-year old asleep on her chest! :-)  

One of the things that I've been doing with Evan since he was about 4 weeks old is giving him "tummy time" on a daily basis. Babies traditionally spend most of their time lying on their backs but of course they need to be on their front if they are ever to crawl. Tummy time has many benefits for a new baby. This is an excerpt from the book *"Baby Massage by Peter Walker"*  

_**Regular waking time spent belly down ensures the structural health and fitness of his body in a way no other natural position can achieve. When your baby lies on his belly, he lifts his head to look around him - strengthening the supporting muscles in his neck. Once he has comfortably reached this stage, he will then lift his head and shoulders, developing strength in his arms and shoulders and flexibility in his spine.**_

_**Having achieved this, he will then raise his head and shoulders even further. This stretches open your baby's chest so that he achieves a deeper breathing rhythm and maximises his lung capacity. And as his chest stretches open, so too does his abdominal cavity - aiding digestion.**_  

So far Evan can lift his head and look around and sometimes he'll lift his shoulders up and prop himself up a bit. A couple of days ago he learned a new trick - he managed to roll over onto his back again!</value>

    <value>This week was probably one of my worst weeks so far. We were due for our checks with our GP and if Evan was all healthy he'd also have his first dose of injections.  

We had both been given the all clear from the GP and Evan had his routine injections. The nurse was very nice and had prepared both injections beforehand to give to Evan as quickly as she could to make it less traumatic for us both. It was horrible having to watch, he was a very brave boy and it wasn't until the first injection was almost finished that he finally let out a cry. He pulled his usual down-lip face that looks ever so cute in its own special little way. He stopped crying but soon started again almost immediately after the second injection was started. This was too much for me to bear and I let out a little *"Oh baby, don't cry"* and my eyes filled with tears too. As soon as the plasters went on and my baby was once again in his mummy's arms we both felt so much better. I cuddled him and soothed him, for too long I suspect as the midwife had to ask me to get him dressed because she had other patients to see.  

We had a slight bottom issue this week after our successful endeavours last week with formula feeding. I had earlier read that breast milk is very easily digested and breast fed babies tend to want feeding more often and Evan demonstrated this by following that pattern. Formula milk is harder to digest and this really messed around with Evan's digestive system by making him constipated. It was heartbreaking to watch him strain and struggle and by the third day he was now crying with each attempt and he was trying to relieve himself regularly so it seemed like he was crying all the time. I do things totally backwards and it wasn't until after we had been to the doctors for our 8 week checks that I became more concerned about Evan's constipation! After a conversation with a nurse on the NHS-Direct helpline she advised me to contact my GP. Whilst on the telephone to the doctors surgery Caroline was in the process of changing Evan and she noticed that one of his legs was swelling after the injections. This tipped me over the edge and I became a bit of a drama queen *(I must grow out of that because I am a mum now and I need to act like one!)* I became overly concerned for Evan now and was crying myself and I was just glad Caroline was around to look after us both.  

We went to see the nurse and she recommended watered down orange juice to ease his constipation and some baby Calpol to make Evan feel better after the injections. Her recommendations seemed to do the trick, the Calpol made him less grumpy and cool flannels made the swelling reduce. We fed Evan the orange juice which was the first feed he has had that wasn't milk. Whilst sitting at the table eating dinner I could hear Evan straining in the push chair next to us and a minute or so later we heard several explosions coming from his bottom region! I smiled sweetly to Caroline and said *"hmmm your turn :)"* Bless him, he didn't like to leave me out *(such a sweetie)* so he did another humungous poo later on that evening for me to deal with. We've decided to leave off the formula milk for a while and we'll ease him into it slowly when he's a bit older. For now we'll just use it as a top up for when my boobs are feeling drained.</value>

    <value>It's been quite a week this week. On Tuesday Evan had to go get some jabs done and usually I would go along with them but I had to stay in and wait for a delivery. I heard all about it when they got back and mummy and baby were both rather traumatised.  

To make matters worse it was on this day that Emma realised that Evan was actually constipated! Because I am at Uni a lot I don't change him all that much so I didn't really notice that he'd not done a poo in a while. Sometimes Emma can be a little overly dramatic and something that seems rather minor can suddenly be blown out of all proportion. This was one of those things! Once she realised that Evan hadn't actually been for three days she got really worried and phoned the GP *(note, this was after she'd come back from the check-up!).* I was changing him while she was on the phone and I noticed that he had some redness and a little swelling in one of his legs where he'd had the injection and that was it - Emma panicked, totally overreacted, burst into tears and was quite inconsolable for a while!  

Not only that but of course her panic came across to the nurse on the phone *(the tears came after the phone call)* and she made out that Evan was having some major allergic reaction to the injection so of course they advised her that we take him back in straight away. He was soundly asleep within about 30 seconds of getting him in the car so I felt a little embarrassed at the doctors so I kind of just shuffled around in the corner and let Emma do the talking!  

With the aid of a little baby Calpol and orange juice we had both problems sorted out by the evening. Not a day I would particularly like to repeat!</value>

    <value>My little boy is growing ever so quickly, we went to see his grandma this week as it's been 5 weeks since our last visit and she couldn't believe how much he had changed. He has pretty much out grown most of his clothes so we're washing daily just to make sure he has something to wear. His clothes and toys allowance will definitely be spent on the former this month!  

I took Evan to see my work colleagues for the first time this week. He was on his best behaviour, he played, smiled, let people hold him and then fell asleep on my shoulder. They all fell in love with him, and why wouldn't they? He is the most adorable little boy in the world! To be honest, Evan is really good all the time and now that he is older and more secure *(maybe all the cuddling did work)* he is actually enjoying playing on his own. He will lay beside me and gurgle to himself and he loves playing with *"Billy Banana"* in his push chair.  

Evan's hair is growing longer and he now has this cute bit that sticks up on top, he naturally has the *"sticky uppy"* look that I try to get everyday but fail at so I am jealous :).  

I have started telling more people about my plans to stay at home so that I'll have a bigger incentive to make it work, as if Evan isn't a big enough one already! We're having so much fun and Evan is starting to get into a routine, which is good for him and it makes our life easier. He tells me when it's bed time so no more late night football for me anymore! Our feeds also happen at roughly the same time everyday it's just a shame that one of them clashes with our dinner time.  

A memorable moment this week was watching Evan looking for boob on my mum and brother when we went to visit them - he ended up sucking their noses! No pictures of that unfortunately but it was rather amusing. Usually he settles for his fist or fingers as he is now very good at moving his hand to mouth.</value>

    <value>We're starting to be able to see some developmental changes in Evan's behaviour now. He's been sucking at his fist for a week or two already but sometimes he manages to be a little more dextrous and actually put his fingers in his mouth and suck those. He hasn't quite found his thumb yet though!  

He's also talking *(making word like noises)* a lot more now. He started saying *"gurrr"* a lot a couple of weeks back but now he has a new gurgle where he really sounds like he's trying to laugh and he tends to do this in direct response to us. We'll quite often have fairly extended play time where we just play with him and talk to him. For some reason his favourite place for play time still seems to be his change mat!  

One of the nice changes that we're seeing is that he's finally starting to show some signs of independence. For the first weeks of his life he was so clingy that we just couldn't put him down for a moment. Gradually this is getting better and now we can usually put him somewhere like the bouncer or pushchair for half an hour or so and he'll amuse himself. Sometimes I wonder if all babies are clingy like Evan or if they all have different personalities.  

We're also realising just how big he is now. He weighed in at 12lbs 12 this week and we've had to relegate another bunch of clothes. The other night I put him in a sleep suit and it seemed to fit until I tried to do up the poppers that go over his nappy and I just couldn't do them up! We didn't have any more clean ones so we just had to leave it undone - it looked like he had a little tail! Poor thing :/</value>

    <value>This week the long awaited *"Baby Massage"* class started, it's only on for 4 weeks but it's just another opportunity to get us out of the house for a few hours to see other babies. Doing the little walk to Somerfield on our own is getting a bit boring and I really think it will do Evan good to get out and about more. We've been doing massage with Evan for several weeks now so this class was mainly for the social aspect as well as just making sure I am doing it correctly. The class is run free by the local health visitors, so that's a great bonus especially now that we are being more frugal when it comes to spending. Evan appeared to enjoy the massage class just as I expected but when all the other babies spent the whole class looking up at mummy, Evan spent it looking at the baby girl next to him!  

We covered *"Sleep and Routines"* again in the Mother and Baby group this week and I came away with a new found motivation to have another stab at giving Evan a bedtime routine. We'd recently started putting him in his PJs at around 6.30pm anyway so now I decided to take it a step further. At 7.30pm every night I attempt to take Evan to bed. I give him a feed whilst we are up there in the dark quiet environment helping him to get off to sleep and then quietly leave the room. It seems to be going quite well, one or two nights he just hasn't settled but I think that was because he really wasn't that tired. Instead of just going up to him every 10 minutes I decided to bring him down again and try again later. This has been very successful so now I am getting a bit of time to myself in the evening, which is lovely. I am also having varied success with naps in the day time as well, for these naps he sleeps in his pram downstairs in the lounge with me and he seems to differentiate well between the two types of sleep.  

We invited our friends over for dinner this week and it was a huge success. Whilst Caroline and I were busy in the kitchen, they tired Evan out for us. Also because we had just started this new routine of putting him to bed at 7.30pm he was particularly tired. I dressed him in his PJs but let him sleep downstairs near us because it's no fun for our friends if he's upstairs asleep. We managed to enjoy the whole meal with Evan asleep in the pram next to the table. We're trying to teach our friends that breastfeeding is no big deal and that they really won't see anything whilst I am feeding in the room. To spare their blushes though, they only had to endure one feed because I had managed to express some milk a day earlier for Caroline to do the evening feed from a bottle.  

Evan makes me smile whenever I think about him or even look at him. I wouldn't change him for the world and even now 11 weeks on, I would not change how we handled new motherhood. I have no regrets whatsoever, he has brought something into my life that I have craved for such a long time and he filled the gap perfectly. Our little family is now complete, though I know there is definitely more love and room to squeeze in a little sibling for Evan ;).  

A memorable moment that I shared with Caroline this week was the undisturbed cuddles that we enjoyed. Usually Evan cries the moment we curl up together and I sometimes think he has this protective sixth sense over me... *"Hands off! She's my mummy"*. However, he was a little angel this week and we were able to enjoy cuddles and he stayed fast asleep throughout.</value>

    <value>Evan has been exercising his new found vocal chords for a little while now but this week he discovered a new trick. He was lying on the change mat after I'd changed his nappy and I was chatting to Emma and suddenly he just let out this loud shout that really made me jump! We both looked at each other and then at him and he just smiled, cutie.  

A few weeks ago we had a visit from one of our friends and she had bought us a nice set of baby vests with one for every day of the week. I often see these types of clothes in the shops but they're not that practical it would seem! It seems like a cute idea to dress your baby in a different outfit every day of the week but the reality, for Evan at least, is that we usually need at least two outfits every day because he just pukes so much! One day this week he just kept puking and pooing on his clothes and I think he ended up with something like four outfits in the one day!! I really should buy some shares in a washing powder company or something.  

A few weeks ago I talked about tummy time and how he was making progress with his neck muscles. It's very noticeable now and he can hold his head up quite still as he looks forward at us. He can also see much further now and really track us with his eyes. If he is lying down on his mat and we walk around the room he'll be following us with his eyes the whole time and I swear he was watching the TV the other day!</value>

  <data name="y1w12One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I introduced Evan to a new environment this week, we went to *"Teddies Music Club"*. Teddies is run once a week and is more suited to children at toddler age as they can interact more. I think it is also good for babies as it gives them new experiences, but they won't be able to sing along to the songs and do some of the actions, however it gets us out of the house for a little bit. I didn't realise this, but Evan had never heard anyone clap - hmm, unless me clapping when Spurs score on TV whilst Evan was in my womb counts? :). We happened to be sitting right next to the lady running the club and she had a really loud clap and as Evan had slept on the way in the push chair, he wasn't quite awake when the club started. When the lady clapped her hands Evan jumped and burst into this really traumatic cry - he's getting good at that! Everyone just looked at us, I smiled and coo'ed to him that everything was ok and after a quick cuddle he seemed ok again.  

It was an interesting experience for both of us and I think Evan started to enjoy it towards the end, though when the children started banging on the musical instruments, even that made me squirm. A year ago I could definitely say that this was not something I could see myself doing, having Evan has really changed me! We rocked and swayed as we sang along to the nursery rhymes. I tried to sing quietly as Caroline likes to remind me that my singing voice is terrible, though Evan doesn't seem to object... yet. £3 for 35 minutes is quite expensive, but if Evan enjoys it, then it's definitely worth it. I am sure he'll be able to hold the maracas soon, so we'll be able to interact more as he develops.  

I love bed time these days, but I can remember as a child never wanting to go to bed, now why is that? It is the worst part to date in parenthood, trying to help a sleepy child get to sleep when they either don't know how to or don't want to. I wish babies would come out into this world knowing how to sleep. If Evan doesn't get his sleep when he needs it, he is very grumpy until he finally gets that rest that is required. This week I managed to put Evan to bed awake and he did fall asleep himself. I was so happy after that success and silly old me thought he'd do it every night. Our attempts at bed time for the remainder of the week were abysmal and by Saturday night I had him sleeping in the push chair next to me in the evenings so that I could give him a gentle rock whenever he stirred.  

Baby Massage was a hit this week, it relaxed Evan so much that he slept for 5 hours straight when we got home!</value>

  <data name="y1w12Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ooh we had a bit of a 'mare this week - the first time I caused an injury to Evan! There were tears... baby tears, Emma tears and there were screams! How did this happen? Well it all started with some baby fingernails and a pair of clippers :/ I'm sure you can guess the rest!  

Due to the little *"jazz hands"* thing he tends to do when he's feeding *(see the piccy in week 6)* it's usually quite easy to trim his nails as he's fairly relaxed and sleepy when he's been feeding for a while and he splays his fingers for me. But this time I'm not sure how I managed it but I snipped the end of his thumb off! Ouchie!!!  

You should have heard the screech! Emma panicked of course but upon examination it turned out to be fairly minor and he soon calmed down.  

As if the finger-sniping trauma was not enough for one week I managed to traumatize the poor boy even more! One night Evan was on the change mat in the bedroom and I was just about to go off to bed. I just went into the room, leant over the mat and said *"Hello!"* to him. Pretty harmless you'd think huh? But nooooo, not for our jumpy little boy - it made him jump and once again he screamed his little heart out. Emma came running in the room shouting *"what have you done to him??"* I picked him up immediately to try to settle him but he screamed like I'd just snipped off more fingers. This was one of those occasions where I just passed him to Emma with a *"your baby"* and let her do the hard stuff! Now, I take care to let him see my face before talking to him!</value>

  <data name="y1w13One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This week I introduced Evan to his cardboard books. He hasn't figured out how to hold them or eat them but he does like to look at the pictures. He woke me up at 6am one day this week and showed no signs of wanting to go back to sleep so we made a coffee for mummy and I plonked him in between my legs so that he was able to sit up. My legs were supporting him on both sides and from that position we sat and read all about racing cars and also about Little Bear's adventures. I've read that babies do like to have the same stories read to them at this age because they like rhymes and repetition.  

His vision is remarkably wide now and I've noticed him looking up on the shelves spotting Caroline's toys in the study when I carry him around. I've also noticed that going for a walk in the push chair isn't great anymore for sending him to sleep. Instead he spends the whole trip looking around in wonderment at the outside world and its surroundings.  

We went to see Caroline's mum again this weekend and Evan loved all the attention from all but one person. He chatted away and giggled at all the funny faces that people pulled. The one person he didn't take a fancy too was a real heavy smoker and as soon as she picked him up he screamed the house down. I wasn't aware of why until we got up close to her and wow the smell was strong. His nanny took him from the lady and he immediately stopped. She was shocked as apparently babies don't cry around her—they must be used to the smoking environment!   

We moved Evan into the bath this week as his feet had started poking over the sink edge! We have this towelling bath support that allows us to be hands free and Evan seems to like the extra space. He's not interested in his ducks yet but startles himself at first when he splashes water over himself every time he kicks but it soon turns into a giggle when we laugh about it. Getting in with him is not so fun because it's mightily cold having a bath in two inches of water!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w13Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Over the last few weeks Evan has started to chew things more. He started off mainly chewing his fist *(which he still does - a lot!)* but now he's started chewing everything else too - his toys, his clothes, and his muslin! He's taken quite a liking to his muslin and he buries his face in it and giggles! We discovered this week that it will actually keep him amused for quite a while!  

Another discovery we made this week is that Evan has started showing an interest in the TV. Is that normal for young babies?? In the evenings we usually change him down on the floor in front of the TV and we use that time to play with him, do a massage, give him tummy time etc. But this week I started to notice that he wasn't so interested in playing and that he kept looking away. I didn't notice anything odd about it at first because he has a weird tendency to look far over to the right anyway but then I realised that he actually had his eyes transfixed on the telly!  

He's been doing it quite a lot and at the weekend we were at a friends house and I was playing with him on a mat near the TV and he kept wiggling around and turning himself to face the TV. So eventually I moved the mat to the position he was facing and he stopped wiggling! It's nice that we've found a couple of things to amuse him so that he doesn't need 100% attention but I hope he doesn't spend his whole life in front of the TV as he gets older.  

One quite cute thing about him watching the TV now though it that now that he can sit up a little easier I can plonk him on my lap leaning up against me and we can watch the TV sitting in that position having a cuddle :)</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w14One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This week Evan had another trip to the injection nurse! I wasn't looking forward to this because I still had images of what happened last time. Caroline came with us this time to make sure we were both ok :). He had to sit on my lap instead of lying on the bed and it was probably for the best because I didn't see his face when he cried so it didn't make me cry. I had to hold his leg down for the nurse, which wasn't what I really wanted to do, I just wanted to be able to comfort him. Caroline let him hold her finger and boy did he squeeze it tight! It wasn't too traumatic this time and a quick cuddle from mummy seemed to do the trick afterwards. We were more prepared this time and were able to give him some Calpol as soon as we arrived home - my poor little warrior *(Apparently the name Evan means warrior, heh).*  

Evan has a new trick, he can now arch his back and push himself up using his legs. He does this to move around at change time, which can make changing his nappy a struggle. The strength in his legs is developing much faster than his arms so now at tummy time he pushes his bum in the air and if we give him support under his feet he will push himself forward. He is showing signs of frustration now because he wants to move around, he's definitely going to be an active little boy!  

The weather has been lovely this week and we are trying to give Evan lots of time out in the fresh air. The sun has been so bright that Evan has to wear a cap, he hates having to wear them but he looks so adorable in it.  

We had our first day trip that was not visiting friends and family this week. We went to an exhibition in London and I can safely say that trips out will never be the same again. You have to prepare so much stuff and I was a naughty mummy because I left expressing milk until the last day and ended up only getting 3 ounces! We took some formula as well and I still ended up have to get my boob out, that boy just eats so much :). One thing I noticed about travelling with Evan was that we had arrived at the exhibition but it then took us another hour and a half until we actually entered. We needed to feed and change Evan and then feed ourselves and of course Caroline needed to visit the toilet several times as well :). All in all it was a great day and I can't wait until our next little adventure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w14Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Emma already mentioned that Evan has a new trick of arching up his back. Sometimes this can be a real nuisance. A few days ago we had him in the pushchair while we were eating dinner. It was tilted upwards and we hadn't strapped him in *(never needed to before)*. Suddenly he started to arch his back and wiggled so much that I actually thought he was going to fall out! Now he gets strapped in everywhere! But one place that we can't strap him is our laps. He frequently sits on our laps now and watches TV or he watches me play computer games but sometimes he'll suddenly arch up and slip right down. One day he'll slip right off!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w15One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As we mentioned a few weeks ago, Evan is now in the big bath as he is now a big boy! He is even starting to outgrow the bath support that we use there so I am not sure what we will do then. The big bath is helping us all to feel comfortable and prepare for our first swimming session with Evan as he needs to get used to having water on his face. It just so happens that he now gets ever so excited at bath times that this week he has learned that flapping his arms and kicking his feet makes splashes... lots of them! He was splashing about so much that we were both laughing and it made Caroline come and investigate the noise. I can't wait until we are able able to play with the ducks!  

As it is now Spring time and this year we'd like to have a lovely garden for Evan to play in we decided to start our gardening. We had a lovely sunny weekend and I managed to get Evan out in it - with the factor 40 just in case! We had him in shorts and I used the fly net and sun brolly attachments on the push chair for the first time. The fresh air was really good for him and he was still nice and warm, he had a really long sleep that day whilst I mowed the lawn and Caroline pruned. It was a lovely family moment and I look forward to many days where we spend quality time together as a family out in our pretty flowery garden.</value>

  <data name="y1w15Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We had a monumental event this week *(kinda)* - Evan crawled! Okay so it was backwards, but he still crawled :) I had him on his belly for tummy time on the change mat and he tends to wriggle around a lot these days and I noticed that he was shuffling himself downwards towards the back of the mat! I watched him and sure enough he managed to shuffle all the way back down until his legs were on carpet and he got a bit stuck and I had to slide him back up. He's done it several times since then.  

I've noticed that he seems to have better coordination in his legs than in his arms. He can push his legs quite forcefully but he hasn't figured out how to move his arms when he has his bodyweight on them. Sometimes when we have him sitting on our laps facing us he'll push himself up into a standing position as if he's trying to climb up!  

I was a little naughty this week and introduced Evan to his first non-milk food: ice-cream! Mmmmmmm. I was eating chocolate and orange flavour and you know how it all melts and goes runny... Well I thought he might like it so I dipped my finger in the runny stuff and popped it into his mouth. He lapped it up, yumm! Emma was rather displeased but she got over it :)</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w16One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I haven't been able to take Evan to the mother and baby group for the past 2 weeks due to his injections the first Wednesday and then me having a tummy bug last week, so I was really looking forward to weighing him this week. He's certainly eating well and I knew he had put on some weight because he's now starting to fit into his 6-9 month clothes and he's only 3 and a half months old now! The last time I weighed him at week 13 he'd just crossed over the 1 stone mark and Caroline was betting he'd be 15llbs at least by now. She was right! Evan weighed in at 15lb 4oz this week.  

I was invited to a weaning workshop this week to give me all the information necessary for when I start to wean Evan at 6 months. I've decided to leave it as late as possible to wean because I want him to get all the benefits of my breast milk and I know at 6 months old, he should be able to eat most food groups. I even got to try baby rice and *"mmmm yummy"* wasn't that lovely.... The health visitor described it as wall paper paste and to only use it as an introduction before moving them on to something like potato. I am a bit weird and even though it wouldn't be my choice of food, it wasn't that bad - it just tasted like really bland porridge or ready break. I can just imagine Caroline's face as she reads this as she hates porridge and always refers to it as puke when she sees me eating it.  

I was really nervous of the idea of weaning at first, but the weaning workshop was really informative and now I am not so nervous at all. I was originally just going to let Caroline handle the cooking and preparation but I don't think it would be a problem if I had to do some of it now. It might actually mean I get to eat more vegetables because we'll be introducing them to Evan and I may as well just make some for me. Hopefully we'll get Caroline to try some as well because I do miss my veggies.  

I went to Mothercare on my own this week and I managed to avoid the temptation to spend loads of money on clothes and toys for Evan! I think I only managed that because I knew I was going into town at the weekend to buy some :). I stuck to my shopping list quite well and only came out of the shop with a few extras, though I still managed to spend £20! I bought the big boy bottles for Evan's evening feeds and I thought we'd try him on the medium flow teats but they turned out to be too free-flowing for Evan as he likes to have these little cute pauses as he feeds because he gets out of breath from all the guzzling. I bought this *"gummy teether"* as the idea is great, but unfortunately as with any dummy at this age, your baby can't really hold onto it and it just falls out. The gummy teether allows us to put some teething gel onto the rubber and then you place it in your baby's mouth and they can bite down on it. I also found some pacifiers that Evan can actually suck on, the others were too big and made him gag a bit. These dummies are angled to fit up at the roof of his mouth and are flatter. I still only plan to use it as a last resort for soothing as I don't want him to become addicted to a dummy!  

My favourite buy at Mothercare had to be the cute toy :/ that I was not supposed to buy... It's cool though and hopefully Evan will be able to hold it soon and bite on the plastic when his gums hurt. It reminds me of a *"Rubix Cube"*, instead of being a cube it is a plastic tube that is easy for a baby to grip with their hands and you can move the tube around to make all sorts of shapes and it has different textures for Evan to explore. Caroline and I like it even if Evan chooses not to.

    <value>What's your worst nightmare when you have a new baby? Well, I suppose there are a million things but one of them might be a washing machine breakdown. Our washing machine has been making strange noises for a while now and it finally packed up at the end of last week. We rushed down to the local store the next morning to buy another one but we had to wait until Thursday for delivery which left us without a machine for almost a week!  

Now this coupled with our little poo problem is not a Good Thing! For some reason, over the last week or so just about every poo that Evan does leaks big time - all over his legs or up his back and of course all his clothes get saturated in the yellow stuff. Not nice. Add this to the usual puking episodes and that adds up to a lot 'o washing! Thankfully we have really nice neighbours and our neighbour Anny offered to do our washing for us *(poo 'n all!)*. It probably looks rather strange seeing us wandering up the road carrying a basket of washing...  

Evan has been getting grisly in the evenings of late. This could be a number of things and teething is probably one of them but Emma felt that she wasn't able to give him good feeds in the evenings so we've started to give him one bottle of formula each evening now. He's now moved onto the big-boy bottles and has a full eight ounces. According to the weight chart on the back of the formula packet, he's at the weight for a five month old! The funny thing is, he's guzzling down his bottle but it doesn't seem to have had any effect on his other feeds - he's still waking up every 2-3 hours in the night wanting more boob! Poor Emma :/</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w17One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This week was the first week that we didn't see a gain in Evan's weight. In fact he had actually lost 4 ounces when I weighed him. I spoke to the Health Visitor at the clinic and she said that they don't like to see a drop in weight but Evan looked really healthy so they would just see how he was when I go to weigh him next week.  

This week at the Mother and Baby group they introduced us to Baby Yoga! It was quite fun and Evan seemed to enjoy it at first but then he got hungry and demanded boob halfway through! I couldn't get him to do the really flexible things with his legs like putting his tootsies in his mouth but maybe that was because I was frightened of hurting him. Caroline didn't have a problem with it though when I mentioned it to her.  

We have a new game that we play with Evan now and it really gets him in a fit of the giggles. I sit him on my knees so that he is facing me and I hold his hands - he's showing good back strength now. I then bounce him on my knees as we laugh and pull faces at each other - he loves it!  

This was the week of new happenings... He also reached out whilst on his tummy and grabbed a nearby toy. Just need to help him figure out how to start moving next.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w17Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After having spent _**weeks**_ painting Evan's room while Emma was pregnant Evan finally got to experience it for himself this week! Up until now he had only slept either in the bed with Emma or had little naps in the pram and had never been in his cot!  

But the time and money has paid off as he seems to like his room and his cot. Some days are better than others of course and there are days when he just screams when we try to put him down to sleep and he can't calm himself down but most of the time he grizzles a bit and then just falls alseep.  

The nice thing is that he seems to like the room itself. We can see him looking at all the pictures on the wall, the pictures on his light, on the curtains - everywhere. When we were decorating I remember telling Emma that going to all this expense and effort was a bit of a waste as it would only really be for our benefit. I didn't think that babies cared much about their room but I was wrong and now I'm really pleased that we made it nice!  

So finally, after four months we're now starting to get a little baby-free time to ourselves in the evenings which is nice. I found it difficult in the first few months when we couldn't seem to do anything for more than about 10 minutes without being interrupted. Looking back I think we made mistakes with Evan from the beginning - we didn't try hard enough to establish a routine and so he never really had a proper sleep routine or regular nap times - even feeding has been pretty much done on the fly. It just goes to show, it doesn't matter how much you read up before the baby is born - nothing actually prepares you for the real thing!</value>

  <data name="y1w18One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caroline returned to University this week and we have really enjoyed having her at home over the past 5 weeks so she was missed - even though she only had to go in for 2 days. I had to cancel a visit to see Evan's great grandmother in Birmingham again *(3rd time now)* and I feel really bad as she hasn't seen him now since he was 6 weeks old.  

The weather has been really nice this week and we were able to introduce Evan to grass - I think he really liked the feel of it on his bare feet. He does like it outside, especially when there is a light breeze as it feels nice across your face and makes the trees move around. We were out sitting on the grass and Poppy came over to flirt with us and Evan followed her with his eyes and actually reached out and touched her fur. She was extremely well behaved - I wonder what she'll be like when he's a little bit older and can run!  

I was eager to weigh Evan this week and am happy to report that he is back to normal. It looks like he has put on a whole pound so I am not sure if maybe I messed up the weighing scales last week because 1 pound in a week at his age is a lot.  

I decided this week to attempt to measure Evan's height. I used a technique that my friends use where you lie your baby on the floor with their feet touching the wall and then you measure the distance from the wall to his head. His height came out at roughly 64cm and going by the chart in his little red book he is just above normal for his age. His weight on the other hand is following the chart line that is above normal but he is still a lovely size :).</value>
  </data>

    <value>It's nice to watch babies grow and develop and learn new things. I remember when Evan was first born and everyone was always saying *"Hold his head!"* but even then he could lift his head up a little. Now he has far better neck control - around 90% I'd say.  

Both of us tend to carry him in a similar position - in one arm facing in with his head looking back over our shoulder. I'm left-armed and Emma is right-armed but other than that it's pretty similar. What we were always finding is that his neck was still a little floppy and if we didn't watch out his head would suddenly drop and he'd head butt us violently on the chin! Ouchie!! Luckily that is becoming a rarer event now so we can pretty much carry him around with one arm without needing to support his head and he can look around quite comfortably.  

We've also been giving him much more opportunity to sit up though he does need our support there. I think he likes it because he can see the world from a different view point and it's funny to see him look down and gaze at his feet!  

Another new thing he has discovered this week is a new squeal - a very high pitched one! There I was engrossed in my oh-soooooo-interesting uni revision *cough* when he suddenly let out an ear piercing squawk that scared the poopies out of me! He does that quite often now. I assume it's a general baby thing and hope he's not turning into a bit of a girlie-boy :D</value>

    <value>Evan was Mr Cool Dude this week :). We had some lovely weather and seeing as it was a bank holiday and the shops would be busy we decided to walk to Mothercare. We both sneezed quite a bit on the way so I do hope he is not going to inherit my hayfever allergies... We borrowed some hats from our friend Sue but Evan has outgrown them already so I decided to splash out on some new hats for my cutie pie and to help with his light sensitivity we have bought him some Baby Banz sunglasses - they look fab!  

Evan discovered his Finding Nemo beach ball in his bedroom this week. I was supposed to be getting him ready for bed and keeping him calm but he loves his bedroom so much that it actually gets him all excited instead! I had him sitting on his dresser facing the wall with me holding his back, at first we were just admiring the pictures on the walls but then he nudged his ball. The ball bounced around on top of the dresser and it just had Evan giggling the whole time. It was really funny and unfortunately we were unable to get any footage on the video camcorder...  

I have started reading to Evan at night time as I was hoping it would help calm him down. However, reading in his bedroom is not working as he spends all his time looking around and fidgeting, we now read out in the hallway on the floor because that has boring surroundings and he will actually look at the book with me.</value>

    <value>Last week I was saying how much better Evan's neck control is and how he hardly ever lets his head flop down onto us now. Well, he likes to prove me wrong! Evan is a pukey boy - he really could puke for England in the World Puking Olympics if there was such a thing! This week he was up on Emma's shoulder after a feed and she was giving him his usual pat on the back to wind him when out blurted a couple of gallons of puke! That's not the best part though - he then plopped his face right down into it! It covered his whole face, he snorted it up his nose; it even managed to get in his eyelashes!! Imagine the marketing possibilities - Puke-encrusted mascara!  

This week was another week for baby firsts - Evan blew his first raspberry, aww :) We've been blowing raspberries at him since he was tiny, it used to scare him sometimes when he was really little but he grew to like it and I always do it on his tummy now when I change him. Recently he's been getting a bit better at doing things with his mouth - he can now spit out something he doesn't like *(such as puke!)* and he blows bubbles. He can only seem to manage the raspberries when he has a gob full of saliva so he kinda just spits at us but it's still very cute.</value>

    <value>Evan and I attended a new group this week called Twinkles. We have outgrown the new mums group and over the past few weeks the health visitors have been hinting that we might scare off new mums because we all know each other. This new group is for babies and toddlers and it was really busy so at least I know Evan will get the contact with other children that he needs.  

I still went to the new mums group to attend the weigh in and will probably do so until after I start weaning as I want to ensure that Evan is getting everything that he needs. Instead of staying for the group we have arranged to go to each others houses for lunch. This week I was walking to the group when I noticed a police car, as I got closer someone stopped me to ask if I recognised a little boy. This little boy was crying for his mum and dad; he was dressed in his pyjamas still and had no shoes on and his face was covered in dirt. He looked cold so I figured he'd been outside for a while. It was just after 10am and the police were knocking on all the nearby doors trying to locate his parents. I later heard from the health visitors that an hour or so later the police received a call about a missing child but it was horrible to think how long he had been alone. It made me think twice about always ensuring external doors are locked when I go to bed; this will be a good habit to get into for when Evan is older. I still don't understand why it took his parents so long to discover he was gone...  

We had lunch at Rachel's this week and I went prepared with some spare clothes as Evan has the tendency to be sick frequently. He totally surpassed my expectations this week and was sick so many times I had him down to his vest and had to borrow some trousers. Luckily for him Alex's mum had some spare otherwise we might have had to borrow Megan's dresses!  

We did an impromptu visit to Evan's grandma this week. We wanted to give Caroline some quiet study time and I desperately needed to get Evan some new vests as the others were getting tight around his biceps. We decided to go shopping with Grandma and we had a lovely time but she did spoil us lots. Evan has some lovely new clothes, but I need to relegate some more small ones to make room!  

Evan is developing really well, his dexterity is improving, he actually reaches out to grab things. He grabbed his twistable toy for the first time whilst on his belly this week. He is also trying to sit up more and he will do so unaided for a few seconds, though he can be a bit wobbly.</value>

  <data name="y1w20Two" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan is getting better and sitting up and not only that but he's starting to stand up too. Of course we have to hold him so he doesn't fall over but he holds himself up on his legs and straightens out his whole body. Sometimes he'll even lift a foot as though he's going to take a step but I think we're a way off that stage yet...  

Over the last couple of weeks we've been changing Evan's routine a little bit. We're trying to get him used to a more regular bed time and being in his cot. One of Emma's friends suggested we try moving his bath from the morning to evening time and then have a wind down time with him where he has his bath, gets read a story and then put to bed. Well ever since we've had his baths in the evenings he has a new found love of the water - he goes mad in there!! Before he would splash a little bit but we just couldn't believe how much he's splashing now - he gets the whole bathroom wet and he just loves it! We tried to take some photos but none of them came out because the movement was so vigorous. We took some footage with the video camera so I'll try and get that uploaded soon instead.</value>

  <data name="y1w21One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I have started to notice these little patches of dry skin appearing on Evan's body. We managed to get rid of one that he has had for months on his shoulder by applying Sudocrem at every nappy change. However, this little persistent one on the head just refuses to go away so this week I decided to take him to the doctors to find out what it was as I didn't want it to be on all his baby photos! Our GP thinks Evan may have a mild form of baby eczema so she has given me a prescription for some Canesten cream - god that cream is used for everything these days! It's done the trick though as we've only been using it for a few days and the patches are not looking as big or as red as they were at the beginning of the week. Hopefully it's just a baby thing as I'd hate for him to have eczema through all his childhood.  

Evan and I usually get ready at the same time in the morning as he is usually at his most contented when he first wakes up. I wash and dress Evan and then jump in the shower immediately afterwards. One morning this week was unusual to say the least. Evan had woken up several times in the night and he sounded a little clogged up in his nose. He didn't want any boob and he just gurgled away to himself playing with his teddy bears that were in bed with us. The gurgling didn't bother me too much as I can sleep through anything but the feet and arms whacking my midriff were an altogether different issue :). He sounded like he had a stuffy nose so I kept him in bed with me just so that I could keep an eye on him, I just had to shuffle to the edge of the bed so that I could avoid the flailing limbs. The following morning we were doing our usual routine, whilst I was dressing I could hear Evan chatting away to himself on the change mat in the bathroom when it suddenly went all quiet. I checked in on Evan and he was fast asleep, he looked so adorable that I just had to go and interrupt Caroline whilst she was studying so that she could see. He is the most adorable little baby in the world...</value>

    <value>Evan made a new discovery this week - one I was hoping he wouldn't make for a little while longer yet - yup, he found his willy!! He's been getting more adventurous with his hands of late and he can lift his legs right up which tips his pelvis upwards too. He was playing in the bath and suddenly I heard this little scream from Emma - *"Oh No, he's got his willy!!!!"*. I came running in to have a look and sure enough there he was giving it a good old tug! It looked rather painful to me but what would I know about that, he seemed to find it highly amusing and proceeded to pull it about lots!  

Evan's uncle Neil and his girlfriend Pascale came to visit this week *(thanks for the extra photos)*. I was out at the time *(in an exam, bleurgh)* but when I came back Emma told me that Evan had managed to drink a little out of a cup. He had the little nozzle thing on it but it's still cute. I've noticed on his evening bottle feeds that I do that he tends to hold the bottle himself with both hands. It's too heavy for him to hold up when it's full but as he empties it out he can pretty much hold it all by himself. Earlier in the week Emma had tried offering him some water in a cup without a nozzle and the poor boy almost choked on it! He makes this funny face - it's the same one he makes when he splashes himself with too much water in the bath. We decided he's not quite ready for a proper cup yet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w22One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We had a lot of new events this week with Evan. He is now exploring further south and now likes to grab his feet and chatter to himself—I'm not sure if he actually knows that it's himself grabbing those little tootsies. Our evening routine is ticking along nicely and Evan has started falling asleep whilst I read him his bed time story, it must be all the frantic kicking and splashing that has worn him out from his bath earlier. He seems to know whenever his nappy is off now and we had an incident earlier where he must have grabbed himself a little too hard and made himself cry—ouchie! To avoid any similar incidents in the bath I tried to distract him with a sponge which he ended up shoving in his mouth and swallowing lots of bath water in the process. I also tried distracting him with his yellow ducks but they were too big to fit into his mouth so he discarded them also. In the end and just for laughs I decided to stick his swimming trunks on to protect his little package and he looked really funny but utterly adorable!  

Evan gave me a little scare this week as he has started to move around a lot more. He has mastered rolling from his back to front so placing him on his play gym whilst I tidy up and do some house chores is not an option anymore as it takes him less than 20 seconds to roll over. He managed to get himself tangled up in the play gym but worse than that he thought it would be fun to try to rollover whilst in the bath. I was just getting some cotton balls from the bag by the side of the bath and in that time he managed to lift his legs up and turn right on to his side submerging half his head. I spun him back over onto his back but the poor little guy had water up his nose and down his mouth. He has yet to try that again...  

I've been eager to start weaning recently and Evan has shown signs of being ready also. He watches intently as I eat my food and occasionally he has opened his mouth to copy me. I have been prepared for weaning for a while now, after the weaning workshop that was run by the health visitors I bought a book to give me ideas of foods to try as I am not a very good cook. My mum bought Evan his spoons and bowls and we now have his *"bumbo"* seat *(another present from his grandma!)*, which is great for feeding him in because it can be easily washed. Evan was 5 months old this week and I decided that the time was right to start weaning him. We mixed some baby rice with some formula milk and away we went! He couldn't get enough of it and loved it. It was rather tricky to get the consistency correct as it kept going runny *(I think that was from Evan's drool though)*. This is when the fun starts though, introducing all the new tastes. I am not the cook in our house but surely pureeing baby food will be easy even for me.</value>

    <value>Earlier this week we had some scorching hot weather and one evening we were sitting in the lounge and Evan was getting so hot that we decided to just strip him off and let him have some nekkid time. There's just something so scrumptious about a naked baby! We had the patio door open and there was a light breeze so *(much to Emma's disapproval)* I took him outside to play in the garden. *"Oh he'll get grass up his bum!!"*, she moaned but Evan didn't seem to mind one bit. He loved it and two of the cats came out to play with us too. I hope he doesn't mind me posting his naked piccies on the internet for all to see!  

Emma already mentioned that we started weaning this week—what fun that has been! He is soooooo cute when he eats, he opens up his little mouth all expectantly but he does this little *"rooting"* thing where he rapidly shakes his head trying to get to the spoon. Unfortunately this usually means that he ends up mouth-butting the spoon and getting the food all over his chops! Aiming spoon neatly into his mouth is quite a challenge!  

Another little milestone was achieved this week when Evan finally managed to start sucking his thumb properly. For months now he's been shoving his fingers in his mouth but he had never quite managed to isolate his thumb but he does now. He still likes to suck his fingers a lot but I think we'll see that change over the coming months.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w23One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I was very nervous about the idea of weaning Evan and my original plans were to return to work in the summer and Caroline would look after Evan instead. That would have been perfect because Caroline being the cook could prepare all his foods. Now that my plans are different I then realised that I would be around at weaning time and I am actually very glad I didn't miss this momentous period in Evans development. I actually look forward to feed time and when we get to try him on new foods. I decided to prepare the carrot *(Evan's first food after baby rice)* because I couldn't wait for Caroline to help. How difficult could it be? Hmmm exactly... What Caroline forgot to mention in her entry was that she wouldn't let me buy more than one carrot because she thought it would make more than enough :). I am not much of a cook and I chose to use the microwave as my learning apparatus—bad choice! I turned this poor little carrot into a rubbery mess... I used the saucepan and followed the guidelines in my weaning book for carrot ala puree attempt 2 and Evan enjoyed the non lumpy carrot so much more.  

We finally took Evan on his longest journey yet this week to see his great grandmother in Birmingham. We've had to cancel this trip a few times previously so she was very excited to finally see him as he was only 6 weeks old when she made the trip down to us to see her very first great grandchild. I went armed with spare clothes because I know what Evan can be like and he wasn't sick at all! This was the first trip we have had to do since we started weaning so we had to prepare even more things in advance and I actually think we didn't take enough with us because he polished off the carrot puree really quickly and still wanted some more so we had to make up a little batch of baby rice which we happened to have with us.  

You'd think I would learn from my mistakes and not attempt too much cooking. Well this week I hosted the lunch at my house for my friends and their babies. It was also Rachel's birthday so I decided to bake a cake. I was not too adventurous, I went for a cake that has been successful in the past. The only missing ingredient this time was having Caroline in the kitchen with me when I baked it. My cherry and almond cake turned out to be a cherry and almond cake without the cherries and almonds. The icing butter that you put in the middle and on the top was made out of caster sugar as well... You'd think I would have associated icing sugar with it because it's called icing butter! It actually turned out much better than you would have thought after reading this :). Now I know why I am usually the washer upper, at least it's giving me practice for when I host Evan's birthday parties in a few years time.</value>

    <value>The weaning continues... we've introduced two new foods this week—carrot and banana. No, not at the same time! We tried the banana first and that probably wasn't the best option as it was really difficult to mash properly! It got all lumpy and kinda slimy and this proved quite a problem. Every time we gave him a mouthful that was a bit too lumpy he'd pull thus funny face, make a kind of gagging noise and poke his tongue out. Highly amusing I thought.  

We thought the banana was tricky; nothing compared to our carrot troubles! You'd think mashing a cooked carrot would be pretty easy? Well yes under normal circumstances it would but not so when Emma is doing the cooking! Baby food has to be soft -  not crunchy, not even al-dente! Not only was the carrot undercooked but because she only cooked one carrot and we went from bowl-with-fork to food processor number 1, to hand blender, to food processor number 2 and back again this meant that we ended up with a walnut-sized lump! To be fair she did much better the next day when she cooked up another big batch of them which we were able to puree properly.  

Evan made a funny face when we first gave him the carrot but he's eaten everything we've given him so he must like it. One of the other funny things about weaning is that the poo has changed! Picture the usual runny greenish poo, now add a little slimy banana, the obligatory lumps of carrot and you've just about got it! YUM!  

I'm getting Evan trained early on the computer. I had him on my lap the other day and he just start whacking on the keyboard, he looked so cute. So we thought it would be funny to load up Word and see what he came up with. He didn't write much but you can tell it was from the heart... [here's his first letter to Mummy](../../../../content/static/Evans_first_letter.doc). His second attempt showed his skills, he managed to bold everything, put page breaks in and even managed to insert a hyperlink! You can read [Evan's second letter here!](../../../../content/static/Evans_second_letter.doc)</value>

    <value>This week we tried some new foods with Evan and also introduced breakfast. We tried Evan on sweet potato and pear, both of which he really liked. We started to do combination meals as well like carrot and sweet potato followed by pear and baby rice for dessert. I have been taking my time with new foods to make sure that Evan doesn't get overloaded with new flavours. I didn't want to try something new everyday but give Evan a couple of days to get used to a new flavour. We've been trying to film all the new tastes on the camcorder but this weekend at Caroline's mums house we mashed up a little melon that we were eating for lunch to see if he would like it. It's a shame we didn't have the camcorder because he pulled this really cute face and didn't seem to like it. We've not really given him the raw flavours on their own as they can be quite overpowering. Instead we have been mixing them with baby rice and milk so this could be one of the reasons why he didn't like the melon, it was cold and all on its own. We'll try him on it again in a few weeks and probably with something else so that the taste is not too strong.  

We didn't get on very well with breakfast this week. Evan gets rather hungry in the morning and it usually takes us around 1 hour to get washed and dressed. When Evan is hungry he hates to be put down so I found it very difficult to make porridge. In the end I had to put him in his swing whilst I made it and he just screamed the house down. I was a little distressed hearing Evan cry and I wasn't really sure of the quantities and at first I tried adding a little formula with the porridge and water to make it taste milky but I added far too much and it tasted fowl. This just prolonged Evan's wait as I had to bin that attempt and start again. When I had finally made the porridge to a reasonable standard Evan was extremely traumatised. I couldn't get him to eat it because he was crying and he just ended up crying with a mouth full of porridge that he then spat out every time he cried spraying me with soggy porridge! I kept having to place him on the boob to console him and then attempted to feed the porridge to him sitting on my leg. It was a disaster, he kept turning toward me looking for boob and smearing porridge all over me and in the end I just gave him boob for breakfast, though I should have let him swallow the porridge he already had in his mouth!  

We went to our final Wednesday lunch this week with the mums that I have met at the *"new mums weigh-in group"*. Rachel is relocating to Bath and Esther is returning to work. It has been really nice to share experiences with people in the same situation as me as talking babies can become quite boring for friends who don't have babies. We decided to do a group photo of all the babies at Rachel's. Evan is such a sensitive little boy when it comes to noises *(yes, this is the boy that cried when he first heard someone clap their hands together)*. Esther was shaking this noisy toy to get the babies attention and they all looked up curiously apart from Evan who looked horrified and cried throughout the whole photo shoot! Ah bless....  

I plan to make the most of my maternity leave just in case I do have to return to work in January so Evan and I are out and about most days and like to visit people as often as we can because he really does love seeing different faces. This week we went to see my mum because we don't really get to see her much and it is a shame. I nearly went out and bought a new stroller but my laziness was more powering than my desire to actually go out to the shops, Caroline will be pleased :). I thought we would spend the whole evening there at one point because we left to go home only to find the main road out of my mums village closed due to an accident. It was funny when I arrived back at my mum's shortly after leaving... The thought of sitting in a traffic jam for hours with an unhappy baby would not have been my idea of fun.</value>

    <value>We had an exciting time this week when we took Evan swimming for the very first time! The local sports centre has a baby pool so we took him there. Emma was very anxious about the whole thing and she held him tightly and just sat in the corner of the pool. At first Evan seemed quite oblivious to the water. He just sat there in her arms chewing his fist and looking around as usual. We were quite surprised because of his antics in the bath.  

So with a little persuasion I was able to convince Emma to let me move around with him a bit more. At first we tried him on his back and supported his underside but this didn't work because he curled his legs up which made his bottom sink into the water. So then we tried him on his front. This was trickier as we had to support his chest and try to stop his face going in the water. This position worked much better and he naturally started to kick his legs about and flap his arms around.  

After a few minutes of this he really started to get into it. Emma picked him up into a sitting position on her knee and he started to splash us both wildly with his arms laughing and giggling :) Our session came to a rather abrupt end after 20 minutes or so when he managed to face-butt the water and get it all up his nose which made him cry :( It was a lot of fun though and we're going to make it a regular event.  

This weekend just gone we went to Southend to visit my mum who we haven't seen since before my Exams which I think was about two months ago. She was astounded at how heavy he had become and almost dropped him when she took him for a cuddle! He always seems to love having visitors and seeing new people. My brother came round who Evan hadn't seen since he was very little. My brother isn't exactly a baby person and despite his best efforts to shoot Evan stern faces Evan still managed to giggle at him.   

Later in the evening we went around to too see my best friend Mel. I thought I already had a photo of her on the site but we couldn't find it when we looked through so I've uploaded one this time! Vicky, a friend of both Mel and I who lives near Mel came around to visit too which was lovely as we hadn't seen her in about three years. She has 3 young children of her own and she's great with kids and boy did it show! She was wonderful with Evan and made him giggle lots. Later on in the evening he was getting tired and she managed to rock him to sleep on her shoulder and he stayed asleep in her arms for about half an hour!  

I love going round to see my friends and wished we lived nearer so we could see them more often. Maybe next time we'll manage to get a photo of Uncle James :) We luv you! _floppy wave_ :D</value>

    <value>Evan saw his grandma several times this week because I really wanted to make use of my free time whilst I am off on maternity leave. I am probably going to have to return to work at the end of the year after all so I have to make sure I enjoy my time with Evan whilst we have it.  

It felt like Evan's and my birthday all in one this week. I had plans to buy him a new stroller type buggy now that we are approaching summer as I really wanted to get a pushchair that could be front facing with Evan sitting up so that he can get to see more of the environment instead of just me :). I took my mum shopping to get a second opinion on the pushchair that I was interested in and we didn't go with that one in the end. In the end we went for this rather funky little number—*'Carrera C' by Jane*. I liked the green and yellow style but that was out of stock so we went with the blue in the end, which is my favourite colour and knowing me I may have regretted buying the bold colour if the green and yellow had been in stock so I am glad we went with blue in the end. My mum bought the pushchair for us as a present so we are very grateful for that - thanks Grandma! xxx  

My mum also gave Evan a selection of new clothes and they are fab! Evan is now a little designer baby with his Levi and Timberland t-shirts and his DKNY jeans! He has better clothes than me now... We've just had a heat wave this week so I have to wait until the weather cools down before he gets to wear the jeans. He has these little cute sleeveless t-shirts now as well and they look adorable on him.  

I am really glad that Evan was not a newborn in the summer time. We've only had two extremely hot days and I am struggling to keep him cool. I don't think he really knows what's going on either, he just likes to lounge about. He still likes his cuddles, but we are generating so much heat together that we just had to jump in the bath together to cool down. We took Evan for our first outdoor family outing this weekend, we went to Burnham Beeches. It's only a few miles away from us and this is the first time I have ever been there! It was a scorcher that day and it was nice to actually walk under the trees for a bit as it was unbearable in the direct sunlight. Evan's new pushchair did well on the rough terrain and Evan enjoyed himself in there too. When he is older we plan to take him on little picnics but hopefully on cooler days as we only managed 2 hours out and we all just wanted to sleep in a refrigerator when we returned home.  

We introduced butternut squash, parsnip and apple this week. Apple was a success straight away and Evan loves this mixed with porridge as a breakfast or as just a dessert. He appeared to like parsnip at first but I can't get him to eat it anymore. I think it's because we are running out of food and I wasn't able to mix it in with something else so all he had was parsnip on its own, which is quite strong. I'll try him on it again in a week or so. He likes butternut squash and that's been his lunch for a few days this week until we go shopping for more supplies and start another batch of cooking.</value>

    <value>Evan is sitting up much better now and he likes to reach out to toys nearby when he is sitting up. This is a good thing because I don't have to have top class reactions times for anticipating when he is going to fall. I tried filming him alone with the camcorder this week and that was a disaster because he wanted to eat it and he was being very playful. I didn't realise how far away I was from him and when he lost his balance sitting up, he started to fall backwards. I threw out my arm but ended up grasping thin air while Evan flopped onto his back - boy his head made a really disturbing thud! I felt really guilty but the good thing about being mummy is that a quick cuddle stops the crying instantly. Evan really likes to sit up and doesn't understand that he lacks the stability. I have to have him sitting up in the bath otherwise he lies there arching his back and fussing. He loves splashing his hands right into the water and grabbing his feet which is cute but he also has the tendency to do it with such force that it sends him toppling forward. Yes... Evan face-butted the water this week, luckily Caroline caught him before he went under but he did manage to get a face full of bubbles!  

Evan's friend Alex went to France last week to visit his family and bought us back a toy that every baby in France has. It's a rubber giraffe called Sophie and she squeaks when you squeeze her. He doesn't have any toys of that texture and he really does like it. He will just chew her and she is really easy to hold. He squeaks her easily whether by chewing or whacking her on nearby surfaces but I don't think he realises that it is him doing it. You can just about make her out in the pushchair picture below (She is also in the week 25 picture).  

To help get Evan off to sleep better at night we are also trying to get up at a similar time each day. I didn't want to have an alarm clock set because the beeping may startle Evan so we had just relied on Caroline waking us up with a morning coffee...mmmm yum.... This doesn't really work out all the time because sometimes Caroline likes to have a lie in :). This week I started setting the alarm clock to come on at 7am but with the radio and not the buzzer. This seems to be doing the trick and it wakes Evan up before it does me. I usually get woken up with a rather disturbing kick from Evan! He'll just lie in bed gurgling away and usually playing with his toes until I decide that I am awake enough to get up.  

We introduced chocolate pudding, papaya, rusk, potato and swede this week. He really didn't like the swede, he was ill on the days we tried it but I decided that I'd rather feed him foods he really likes because there is enough of them rather than feed him foods that he would take purely because he was hungry. He vomited all the food up whilst he was ill so we had him on a bland diet until he was better of just plain porridge for breakfast and plain baby rice for lunch because he was even struggling to keep the milk down. I have had to increase the quantities this week because one day he ate all of his porridge and was still hungry so I followed that with mashed up rusk, which he ate enthusiastically.</value>

    <value>Over the last couple of weeks we've been trying to establish more of a routine for Evan - regular feed times, nap times and bed time in the evening. But just lately he's really started to fuss in the evenings. I think he's got to that age where he really knows that if he screams his head off Emma comes running and I think he's playing us good!  

At the end of last week we took him round to Emma's mums and we made the mistake of trying him out in the travel cot - boy did he throw a paddy! After that I decided that we had to put a sharp stop to this behaviour before it gets out of hand. I had a read around and I read about a man called Richard Ferber who wrote a famous book about getting babies to sleep. His system is harsh but apparently effective. The idea is to establish a clear night-time routine (like, bath, story, bed) and put the baby down awake. He'll cry but you leave him for a set time and then go and soothe him *without* picking him up. It's very difficult because his cries get worse and worse and each time you leave him longer. We've been trying it for a week and it's extremely tough on Emma to leave him but I think we are making some progress. However he was a bit poorly in the middle of the week which didn't help.  

To add to the sleep problems, almost overnight he's just suddenly started rolling over in his cot. At first it was cute, we went in his room and found him on his side with his arm hanging out of the bars! Unfortunately he also rolls completely over and then lays with his face in the mattress which is not safe so of course we keep having to go in there and flip him over which inevitably wakes him up. Bit of a nightmare really. However, I'm determined to stick with it because otherwise I have visions of this little boy throwing tantrums at bed time for years to come and I really don't think I could cope with that!  

We've had some scorching hot weather over the weekend so we bought a little paddling pool for the garden and rather than go swimming at the local sports centre we've been having some little sessions in the pool in the garden. It was funny at first because earlier in the day the water was still a little too cold for him; we dipped his toes in and he flayed his limbs held his breath and did his little heavy breathing thing that he does just before he cries! By late afternoon the sun had been on the water long enough to make it nice and warm and then we could all get in and have a splash about.  

On one of the afternoons we had some Cornetto ice-cream and let Evan have a little then he kept crying. Emma thought he was tired but he wasn't - he just wanted the ice-cream! So she'd give him a little more, take it away and he'd cry again! It was his first ever food and he like's it! It was very cute watching him try to shrove the whole thing in his mouth :-)  

At the end of this week *(Sunday 26th)*, Evan will be six months old! Half a year gone by already...Sometimes it feels like six days, other times like six years!</value>

    <value>Evan has the most adorable fluffy blonde hair and one day this week I just had the urge to put some hair wax in his hair. I tried to hide this from Caroline but she noticed as soon as I walked into the room :). "What have you put in his hair you naughty Mummy!" she said... He did look really cute with his hair doing a trendy scruffy look.  

Evan is developing really well and his routine is really starting to go smoothly. He's on 3 meals a day and now only has breast feeds throughout the night when he wakes.  

Evan is developing such good strength in his arms, he can now lift his upper body completely off of the ground. He also has extremely good strength in his grasp! He really likes to pull my short hair when I carry and nuzzle him :). Glad I have short hair instead of long!  

This week Caroline came with me to weigh Evan as she has never done that before. We were on our way to collect her exam results for her 2nd year at University. She got all A's so we are really proud of her. She got to meet a few of the babies that were born around the same time as Evan and also to see how a baby weigh in clinic works.</value>

  <data name="y1w28One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This week Evan decided to throw his dinner at his mummy! I haven't bought a high chair, though we'll be going to the shops soon because Evan is outgrowing all the other chairs that we use for feeding. We've started feeding him in his bouncer and beside the fact that he has now figured out how to bounce himself, there is also no plastic tray and he can lean forward towards me. He caught me by surprise one afternoon and this time flicked the spoon out of my hand missing him, the chair, the floor but hitting me square on with a spoonful of mush! Evan does look extremely cute when he bounces himself up and down in the bouncer and it makes him giggle lots. He quite likes to bounce a lot after feeding which isn't the best plan as it usually makes him vomit.  

We had another new milestone this week, I was able to get Evan to go back to sleep in his cot after a night time feed. We both fell asleep whilst he was feeding, but when I woke up a little while later I moved him back into his cot in his bedroom.  

To add to the dribbling and wet t-shirts, Evan has now decided that he actually quite likes to suck his t-shirt. This is a nightmare because it just soaks his t-shirt with his saliva that he ultimately needs a new t-shirt afterwards! Maybe I am not feeding him enough :).  

We had an unusual event at the end of this week. Caroline became ill on Thursday and I ended up rushing her to hospital, she does like to do things in style. I was right in the middle of feeding Evan his lunch and I couldn't find anyone to watch Evan so he had to come with us. It took me longer to get her to hospital but we did manage it eventually. I had Evan in the pushchair and I also had to get Caroline into a wheelchair - have you ever tried pushing a wheelchair alongside a pushchair? - not easy. Evan was really good at the hospital because we were there for a long time before I could find someone to look after him. The nurses loved him and he liked all the attention; I even managed to get him to have a nap in the pushchair!</value>

    <value>This was a weird week and one I found hard to cope with. Not having Caroline around was horrible and Evan and I missed her dearly. My family and friends were brilliant this week helping with Evan so that I could sit vigil beside Caroline's bed in hospital. She was moved into intensive care this week and it meant that no children were allowed at all, so I couldn't even take Evan in with me if I was stuck for a baby sitter. I felt terrible leaving Evan for hours on end but I needed to be with Caroline for when she woke up. I would give Evan the biggest kisses and cuddles before leaving him and also upon my return.  

My mum was absolutely great, she made the long trip everyday that I needed her and she also slept on my sofa when I didn't want to be home alone. I think Evan enjoyed all the attention from all the different people and it didn't interrupt his routine much. I'd return home after midnight to find my baby boy fast asleep in his cot. I even had Caroline's mum staying with me for a week so that she could visit Caroline everyday and I think she also enjoyed being able to spend so much time with Evan watching him. I am not sure how I would have coped if it were not for my family and friends.  

This week has helped me realise what it will be like when Evan goes to nursery, we will be separated from each other for several hours everyday. It was horrible but something that just has to be done. I missed out on a lot of new developments this week but he wasn't shy in showing me second time around when I was there to see them.  

Evan has started to do a bum shuffle to move himself forwards, but usually ends up falling onto his tummy. He also likes head butting the floor, which usually results in a hearty cry and sore nose if there is no pillow there to protect him.  

Evan also decided to save all his mega poo's for his grandma as a special treat just for her! The funniest just had to be when she wiped him clean, only to get the nappy and find that he was covered in poo again. She did this three times before realising that it went right up his back, neck, hair and even under his arm pits - yukky! Those clothes had to be soaked before washing!  

Evan has mastered sticking his tongue out and he then clamps his gums down on his tongue making this little cheeky cute face. I think Evan will be crawling soon, he has started sleeping on his knees with his bum in the air and when lying on his tummy he will move his feet towards his tummy pushing himself forwards. He just needs to perform this movement when he is pushing himself off the ground and then he'll be off.  

I had to get a passport sized photo done for Evan this week and boy is that easier said than done. After speaking with the health visitor a few months ago about this, she said always take another person with you because one person is required to hold the baby up at the screen, whilst the other person presses the buttons. I let Caroline's mum go shopping whilst I did this, so I was alone at first. I imagine it's easier with a small baby than it is with an older baby who is more inquisitive. I just couldn't get him to look at the screen, he was more interested in the flashing buttons below. I was shouting for him to look at the screen and I even tried whacking his toy against the window to get his attention. You only get 3 attempts at a photo and the first batch were awful. I had to pay another £3.50 for a second attempt when Caroline's mum returned and she helped me get him to look up at the screen. I finally managed to get a non blurry picture but of course Evan is frowning :). It was so hot that day that I was really stressed out and hot after this mini nightmare.  

Evan treated his grandmas to a new trick whilst I was visiting Caroline in hospital this week. He was lying on the sofa next to them holding his feet (which he loves to do) He placed the soles of his feet together and started clapping his feet together. He then let go and continued to clap his feet together on his own. Very cute and he showed me this when I got home and his also showed Caroline the next day when I took him into visit her because after 6 days in intensive care she was finally back in a ward.  

I brought out some new toys this week for Evan to play with because he showed interest in these kinds of toys whilst visiting his friend Alex earlier in the week. He has a telephone that makes noises when pressed and also some plastic rings that can be stacked on a spike, though he's probably a little too odd for the latter toy. He's more interested in eating the spike making himself gag!  

Evan slept right through the night once this week and I am now offering him only water when he wakes in the night as I am hoping to stop breast feeding completely now. He is such a good little boy and even through this hard week where I was unable to give him all the attention he needed, he was very well behaved even when he missed out on important naps.  

My mum spoilt Evan this week by buying him some lovely clothes and toys when she looked after him and she also bought the highchair and car seat replacement that I wanted. Thanks very much grandma, we loved seeing so much of you. My mum made me smile in a week when I couldn't think of happy thoughts when left to my own devices.  

We were very pleased to have Caroline back home at the end of this week but it was also a very long 11 days and I am sure I have grey hairs now!</value>

    <value>I think I can confidently say that I have just experienced the worst week of my entire life. As Emma mentioned, I had to go into hospital, for my own benefit I've started writing a hospital diary which can be seen [here](../../../../hospital/day/1) if interested.  

I must admit that I've been probably less than helpful with Evan so far over the past six months. I've thrown myself into my University work and pretty much let Emma do all the _mum_ stuff. A few feeds and changes has been about the basis of my input. But boy did I miss him being away from him for an entire week! I really worried that he'd change a lot and I'd miss out on stuff and he did! His feet are bigger, that hair-do - wow!, and he even has new tricks.  

Emma brought him into hospital to see me a couple of times which was lovely. I'm glad this happened when he is young and really doesn't have any idea of what went on. He was very well behaved in hospital and just played on my bed and made many of the nurses and other patients smile.</value>

  <data name="y1w30One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan's highchair arrived this week and we started feeding him in that, safely strapped in and no chance of bouncing around and making himself sick :). He really liked it though and he loves it when the cats hang around at our feet thinking it's feeding time for them also.  

We had a projectile puking incident this week! I'd just finished giving Evan his bottle and he must have had some trapped air or something like that because the moment I sat him upright on my knee to be winded, he just brought up a couple of ounces of milk and he managed to splatter it quite far over the lounge carpet. Luckily we have the carpet cleaners coming next week so this incident coupled with Caroline throwing a full cup of black coffee across the floor made our beige carpet look a little worse for wear.  

Evan is quite a wriggle pot and this doesn't change when he is sleeping. Gone are the days when he'll remain in the same position all night long. This week we found him for the first time facing the opposite end of the cot - he'd managed to do wriggle around so much that he had done a 180 degree turn. It initially gave me a little scare when I saw his feet where his head should have been because I had visions of him with his head under the blanket! The blanket is the first thing to be kicked off so I had needn't worried.  

We successfully got Evan to sleep in his travel cot this week whilst we were visiting our friends in Stevenage. We had tired him out in the evening with all the play time. He grizzled at first when I put him down to sleep but then he'd done a poo in his nappy. I changed him and his cried again - yes he's done another poo! I think I must have interrupted him mid-poo the first time. After 2 dirty nappies Evan went to sleep with little problems. We had no problems transferring him to the car seat to go home and when we arrived home his remained asleep whilst I transferred him into his cot at home.  

Evan loves his new big boy toys, the best buy just has to be the stacking cups. They tower over him when built up and he knows exactly what will happen when he knocks them. He now closes his eyes in anticipation of the inevitable collapse of the tower. Sometimes I can't get it built fast enough and he'll knock it down whilst I am building it. I've resorted to building out of reach and then moving it closer to him. If I leave it out of his reach, he'll do his bum shuffle to get close to it! What a little cutey.</value>

    <value>This has been a strange week for me as it was my first week at home out of hospital. As I have been so incapacitated Emma has had to do everything with Evan and around the house - I can't even do nappy changes as leaning forward hurts too much. I missed Evan in hospital and he changed quite a lot in those two weeks but because I can barely interact with him even now I feel a bit disconnected. Aside from the physical pain, I have also felt drained of energy and haven't had the energy to pull silly faces at him. But I'm hoping that will all get better in the coming weeks.  

The lack of sleep and stress from the whole hospital incident has also left me feeling highly strung and very emotional this week. I felt bored because there was nothing to do but frustrated because I didn't actually want to do anything! Emma suggested we go and pay my mum a surprise visit so we did! The long journey was quite a strain just a couple of days out of hospital but it was nice to see her.  

Now that Evan is seven months old we've started him on 'Stage 2' weaning which introduces lots of new foods. One of the things we thought we'd try was spaghetti bolognaise! Big mistake! Emma didn't realise that she needed to mix it with pasta so all she brought down to Southend with us was just a tub of the bolognaise sauce and as it was made with a jar of sauce it was particularly rich. You should have seen his face when we tried it on him! He hated it! That was the first food he has really objected to - he has pretty much liked everything else we've tried. Next time I'll make my own Evan-friendly version of bolognese in a much blander way and we can serve just a little of the sauce with lots of pasta!</value>

    <value>I did my last morning boob feed last Wednesday (20th July) and I am really starting to notice them drying up. I am expecting it to take roughly 2 weeks. At the moment it is very strange and uncomfortable at times. The boob that had the last feed is coping a lot better than the one that was not relieved... As the ducts dry up, it makes your boob look really weird instead of having engorgement all over, you tend to find that just parts of the boob are engorged. Evan seems to really like to grab at my boobs so I am finding that incredibly uncomfortable at the moment. I do hope my boobs aren't too saggy as they were one of the nice parts of my body before pregnancy. I've been told by my mum that the skin won't stay loose and detached from the underneath forever and over time the fat will come back. I had dropped from a DD cup to a C cup and then nothing, so I brought some new bras because the nursing ones had become uncomfortable and were no longer providing me support. I've since regained my pre-pregnancy size of a B cup so the new bras had a short life!  

I weighed Evan again this week and his weight gain has certainly slowed down, he's still not quite 9kg, but very close. I'll probably weigh him once more before I return to work. I've bought this wooden height chart that looks like a giraffe - it's very cute and we'll have fun marking Evan's height off on that when he's a little bit bigger.  

Evan was a little sensitive this week and for some reason I just kept making him cry! How devastating is that?!!? I was playing with him, pulling faces and making funny noises and they had the opposite effect and made him cry instead! You think I would learn after doing this twice! No, I had to make him cry three times - my poor baby boy. I hate seeing him cry and because this was such a silly moment it made me laugh instead. Gawd, I have such a sensitive little boy :).  

Caroline has a new game that she plays with Evan, "The Boo Game". Very simple, she just pulls cute little faces and says "Boo" in different tones and multiples, it has Evan in stitches, he can't get enough of it. He probably would have done the same with any word because I am sure it is all down to how you say it and what facial expression you are showing. Quite amusing to watch them though... *"Boo.."*, "Boo, Boo...", *"Boo, Boo, Boooo..."* etc.  

I had my first birthday as a mummy this week on the 30th July and Caroline even got me a card signed from Evan.</value>

  <data name="y1w32One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This was another stressful, hectic week. We had our anniversary and enjoyed a lovely meal at a Chinese restaurant in the Village near to where my mum lives so that she could baby sit for us. It was a successful evening and Evan slept ok in his travel cot.  

Our week then deviated from normality. Caroline attended a nurses appointment for a scheduled dressing change on her surgery wound only to find out that she needed to return to hospital for some antibiotics as the wound had become infected. It was not as straightforward as getting the antibiotics and then returning home... Once there, she was notified that it was a ten day course and an IV was required so she would have to be admitted to the hospital. Being sick and in hospital is one thing, feeling fine and being trapped in hospital is completely different. My mum again saved the day and has pretty much lived with me this week to help look after Evan so that I could spend time with Caroline hoping to relieve her boredom. When will this mini nightmare end....?  

This week I have started to notice that as long as when Evan awakens there is no dirty nappy or he is not overly hungry or unhappy etc, he will quite happily enjoy a little chatter time with himself and his teddy giraffe that we have named Gerry who sleeps in his cot. It is lovely having Evan's chatter sessions as my wake up call, it's lovely just listening to the sounds he makes. Sometimes he will quite happily chat to himself for 30 minutes while I just lay in the next room listening to him whilst I wake up fully - he's such a cutie.  

Evan has been pulling at his right ear this past week and I decided to get him checked out by the Doctor. She examined his ear, which was very hard to do because he kept trying to turn his head to look at the probe thing she was trying to put into his ear. He has a build up of hard wax and I have to put a few drops of Olive Oil (for the skin) into his ear to help dissolve the wax. This is a nightmare procedure to do when there is only one of you and I tend to get Olive Oil everywhere!  

Seeing as Caroline is away for 10 days, I have had to do lots of cooking for us all and I also had to clip Evan's finger nails as they were starting to get quite sharp. Again, he kept trying to grab the clippers and in the end I had to use my arm and shoulder as a shield to stop him from getting a look at what I was doing. It was a long procedure but he was very patient in the end.  

Feeding is becoming a much longer task now as the food is much lumpier and Evan is so easily distracted. I have tried various positions but if it's not the TV, it's the cats wandering around or even the garden that Evan finds more interesting than eating, except when it's pudding of course! It can take me up to an hour on a bad day to feed him :). I've started trying him with finger foods now, he loves cucumber sticks.  

Evan has really mastered the art of bum shuffling. He became obsessed with the TV unit (which has no doors) one evening this week and three times in the space of 5 minutes he bum shuffled over to the unit and started pressing at the buttons and attacking the video flap! I think it's time to get a new baby safe TV unit. Here was me thinking we were safe from this because Evan is not a crawler!</value>

  <data name="y1w33One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan had an afternoon at his friend Alex's house this week. He also had the pleasure of spending time with Megan as she had travelled all the way from Bath to visit family and friends. It's lovely to see babies playing together and they absolutely adore other babies. Megan and Alex are both crawling and Evan was quite content with his little bum shuffle, and didn't mind it when Alex crawled all over him - it actually made him giggle! I think Evan will do fine at nursery when he starts next month, though he does like a lot of attention most of the time and I don't know if they will be able to provide him with the amount of attention that he gets from me. Just thinking about the long day apart from each other is horrible and very daunting for me.  

I tried Evan on pasta and cous cous this week and they appeared to go down very well with him. We have only had potato as a base for his meals for several weeks now and I was desperate to have something else to offer Evan as I am sure he is starting to get bored. I tried Evan on spaghetti to begin with but then I found tiny pasta shapes whilst on a shopping trip at Tesco. I also found flaked rice at Tesco and that was a great find as he had certainly outgrown the baby rice. We also tried Evan on some more finger foods following on from our successes the other week with cucumber, so this week we decided to try toast with margarine and also toast with marmite - both were a huge *messy* hit. He'll suck the toast until it goes all mushy and detaches. I find it very scary watching him eat finger foods like this as I am so worried he'll choke... but he has to learn to eat, I just wish there was an easier way.  

Evan is showing greater strength these days and quite often pivots around to the side using his arm on the ground. He can lean forward so that he gets onto his knees but then he sits back up. He is also finding that when a toy is out of his reach that he is able to reach it by leaning on one hand in its direction and then he uses he other hand to reach further towards the toy enabling him to grasp it.  

Evan's increasing stomach and back strength is showing that he can now quite happily stop himself from falling backwards - though sometimes his bum shuffling propels him a little faster than he would like causing a head banging moment. This can be quite dangerous as this week Evan managed to topple forwards into the coffee table. He somehow managed to get his face stuck against the side of the table with one hand on the floor and the other trying to push himself off of the table. You feel like you are running in slow motion when things like this happen, my mum got to him first and rescued the poor little chap, though he had a mark on his face for a few minutes after that. However, there is nothing quite as comforting as a cuddle *(maybe a boob feed :/...)* and he was soon oblivious to the recent event as he happily bum shuffled around the room again.</value>

    <value>Caroline came home from hospital at the start of this week and hopefully that's the end of this nightmare. Whilst in hospital Caroline was able to rest and her surgical wounds are now looking so much better. Caroline had bought some special cream that you can rub into scars that will hopefully soften them and make them fade. She bought from the US and so to make the shipping a one off, she bought 5 tubes of it, unfortunately for her she has shown an allergic reaction to the cream. Waste not want not - I've started using it on some of the stretch marks around my belly button, it's probably too late for them as they have turned a silver colour now and the cream recommends using on scars and stretch marks when they are still red.  

Evan has decided that he no longer likes cucumber. One lunch time this week I offered him some sticks as finger food. He pulled this very cute funny face and I am assuming it was because the cucumber felt all sludgy between his fingers especially when he squeezed the stick into mush! He wouldn't eat it and just kept pulling a face and insisted on playing with the cucumber in his hands. Anyway, cucumber is now off the menu for the time being.  

Evan has started showing a keen interest in helping me at lunchtime. He has a habit of trying to take the spoon out of my hand. I know when I am being too slow because Evan opens his mouth before the spoon is anywhere in the vicinity of his mouth and he then tries to grab the spoon and forcefully help me direct it towards his open mouth. I tried giving him a spoon to play with, but this caused more problems as he knew exactly what it was for and kept directing it into his mouth at great speed, usually making him gag in the process!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y1w35One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I think Evan has lost that natural swimming reflex that he had when he was younger and we unfortunately haven't been able to take him swimming as much as we had liked over the summer period. When we first took him swimming a few months ago, if you went into the water with him lying on your hand belly down, he would flap his arms and legs in this swimming reflex. He doesn't do this anymore when we take him. He was a little subdued this week in the swimming pool and just wanted to cuddle me and grab the lane dividers. He does however love the swimming pool showers, it sprays him and makes him giggle as he attempts to grab the water spraying down. Since we discovered how much he likes the shower, I sometimes take him in the shower with me when we are at home because it keeps him amused whilst I wash him.  

I enjoyed a funny moment this week, I'd just been tidying up the kitchen ready to settle down to a movie with my woman when I decided to just check up on Evan. We tend not to cover him up with the blanket when we first put him down because he just ends up kicking it off straight away. Whilst checking on him, I tucked him in and gave him my usual kiss on the head. I returned downstairs and Caroline popped out into the kitchen for a few minutes. She then returned saying *"You'll never guess what! He has managed to wriggle under the blanket and also cover his arms."* I laughed and then informed her that I had just been up to check on him just a few minutes earlier and he hadn't done the same for me - funny mummy.  

We went to visit Caroline's mum this weekend and this was the first time that we were actually going to stay the night, to the delight of her mum. Evan did really well except it was difficult at times with it being a mobile home and the lounge being next door to his bedroom and having to have the TV up fairly loud for Caroline's mum who is going a little deaf. I was assisting Caroline with a nappy change in the little room that Evan was staying in when she threw the nappy to me in a way that actually launched the pooey contents instead! I am not sure how I managed to catch the nappy and the still have the contents safely tucked up inside - now that would have been an awkward conversation to explain to her mum!  

Of all the days to have my periods finally return, they choose the weekend away! It took me by surprise and at first I thought I had wet myself, but no it was my first period for 17 months! Luckily we had some tampons with us in the travel bag as I was worried I'd have to send Caroline to the nearest all night petrol station or worse use some ancient tampons that Caroline's mum may have had in the bathroom cabinet from when Caroline last lived at home.</value>

    <value>This week Caroline made Evan a fish pie and we are no longer using the little ice cube sized potions for main meals as he would be having about 3 or 4 of them by now. Instead we are using much bigger single containers and I probably think that these are a little too much for Evan at the moment but I'm sure it won't be for long. All it means is that we have some leftovers because he gets bored *(though he always has room for some pudding!)* He enjoyed the fish pie and it was very fishy indeed with quite a strong smell. As the meal progressed Evan started to get bored of the fish and my reactions weren't sharp enough when he decided to thrust his foot into the dish claiming a substantial amount of fish pie on his *(luckily)* naked foot. Errrgh it went between his toes and even after cleaning up the little grubby boy his foot still smelt like a fishy foot pie!  

I wanted to show Evan the sand, sea and snow before his 1st birthday and this week we achieved two of those objectives! We went for a trip to Boscombe Beach in Bournemouth. It was a lovely day and we could have done with air conditioning for the drive there because it took us just under 2 and a half hours! It was lovely to see his reaction to the sand - especially wet sand. He couldn't stop giggling when we covered his feet and legs up with wet sand. He kept kicking it off and laughing when we poured it back on. I think Caroline was the most excited about this trip as it gave her an excuse to buy a bucket and spade and build a sand castle - which Evan and I promptly knocked over :) mwuhahaha. These are the moments that Caroline enjoys most about having a family, she gets to do these little things that can bring so much happiness into our lives. As Evan gets older I am sure he will appreciate these days out more so.  

I was most concerned about Evan eating the sand but he didn't show any signs of wanting to eat it, he did however enjoy how it felt to hold it. The nightmare was when Evan started to get a little bit tired or the sun was too bright - he'd rub his sand covered hands into his eyes! Our solution to this problem was to put on his baby banz sun glasses and this appeared to work as it protected his eyes from the bright sun and also from the sand. The sand was really fine and it got everywhere, it took me a couple of days to rid Evan's hair of sand completely.  

One thing is for sure, our holidays and days out will never be the same again, I didn't get a chance to lay down in the sun and relax as Evan needed our constant attention. Caroline's respite from all the chaos was to head off into the sea to relax!</value>

    <value>We have a tooth! I noticed Evan's gum looked a lot paler this week and realised that it was the tooth coming up through the gums. He's had his grumpy moments this week - more so than I have experienced so far and he's also had a couple of days when he didn't want much dinner or evening bottle. I figured that this was finally the teething that we'd thought we were experiencing all those months ago. It's quite funny actually, as we have been putting dentinox on Evan's gums on and off since he was 3 months. I've only just bought a new tube of the stuff and I am starting to think that maybe it was never teething all those months ago. The health visitors never said anything to the contrary but I am sure they were probably thinking newb! every time I said of maybe it's his teeth that is making him grumpy. It was probably sleep, food or just mummy's cuddles that he actually needed. They say your first child is always the hardest and by number two it'll all be different because you know what to expect. I just hope my failings never affected Evan permanently. His first tooth is the bottom one on the right side of the middle. He also got his left big tooth as well and he enjoys grinding them together whilst the rest of us cringe!  

Evan can now sit up in his cot and this new achievement has brought along a few issues. He sits whenever I take him to bed and either plays with his teddies and finally flops down when he is tired or if he is determined not to sleep, he will bounce around crying heartily and then bump his head on the bars - this in turn causes the most traumatic cry I have ever heard from him. We had to use the arnica bruise cream for the first time *(of many I am sure)* because one of his bumps on the head looked quite nasty.  

Evan is so close to crawling at the moment, he can get up onto all fours and he attempts to move his arms but either falls on his face or succeeds in moving backwards. He can still get to places with great ease and speed though, he does this weird crawl where he will move forward onto all fours and then twist round onto his bum in the direction he wants to go. Then he will turn and repeat the procedure until he has made it to his destination. We have decided to buy a play pen because even now with his limited movements, he can quite easily get up to mischief. The play pen has allowed me the opportunity to safely deal with chores such as hanging the washing or preparing lunch knowing that I can quite happily watch him through the doorway and know that he is safe. I don't use it that much but it's nice to know I have it there when I need it - finally I can pee in peace! :).  

Evan gave me a shock this week. I am assuming his teeth are causing him some discomfort because he really likes to munch on anything hard, mummy's chin for starters. He has also taken a liking to my neck and this week he managed to suck my neck so hard that it left a mark!  

I've been looking around at cars recently because it has become apparent that we really do need a bigger car for those family trips away. We went to look at a Ford Focus this week and I thought it was lovely, it was the colour I wanted, it had all the requirements that we wanted on our next car - air conditioning etc, so we decided to take the plunge and buy it. Typical! 9 months of using a rear facing removable car seat in a 3-door car and just as we are about to upgrade to a permanent forward facing car seat, we upgrade to a 5-door car. Evan loves his new car seat and we can fit the travel cot and push chair snugly into the boot of the Focus. I haven't lost my lovely clio permanently as Caroline has kept that car for herself and I get the new lush family car - cool huh!</value>

    <value>This is my penultimate week at home with Evan so I decided to get Evan weighed as I don't know when I'll next be able to do it. He is definitely big enough for his new car seat now as he weighed in at 20lb 4oz, which is a few grams over the 9 kilo requirement.  

We took Evan swimming again this week and at first we thought it would be a nightmare as the water was much colder than it had been on previous visits and Evan's teeth started to chatter at first. He was ever so excitable though and he got some good swimming actions going with his feet pumping really fast and arms flapping out to the sides. I still think he would go under if I had let go of his tummy though, but still it was such a cute sight to see and I wish I had had a water proof camera handy. He loved chasing Caroline around the baby pool and splashing her when he finally caught up with her. I hope we still find the time to take Evan swimming at the weekends when I return to work as it is lovely to see him playing and enjoying himself in the water.  

We went to Bath this week to visit Evan's friend Megan, we wanted to get a trip in before I returned to work. We travelled down with Alex and his mum Nathalie who was kind enough to offer to drive. It was lovely to have all the children together for one last play session and it's amazing how far they have all come. It only seems a little while ago that they were all tiny little newborns - well in Evan's case maybe a chunky little newborn :). I forgot my camera, so unfortunately I don't have any pictures of this one, though Evan did seem to enjoy Megan's ball pit. Not sure we'd have enough room for one of those in the house and it did look great fun as I wanted to jump in with them.  

All week it has looked like Evan was getting closer and closer to crawling and finally on Saturday morning before I headed off for a visit to Grandma's Evan chose to show Caroline and I his first proper, slightly stumbled, crawling steps. It is just the cutest thing to see, his little arms just stomping around in a movement that reminds me of the cats when they are walking through long grass. They kind of dip their legs in one at a time in a stomping movement and that's exactly what Evan's crawling looks like - it's absolutely adorable.</value>

    <value>Well this is it... The time has come for me to return to work. Unfortunately as much as I love spending time with Evan and being his full time carer, I have to pay the bills and if I am to ensure that Evan has lots of great things, I need to earn some money. I think nursery will be good for Evan because he loves the social aspect and playing with different toys that he doesn't have at home and seeing other babies. I think he would have become bored at home with me as I certainly wouldn't be able to do the kinds of activities that nurseries can do very easily. Nurseries have a good structure as well that ensures that they are well prepared for pre-school life. I have absolutely loved my time with Evan over the past 9 months and if I could have afforded it I probably would have opted to stay at home with him a little longer. We've done loads of baby groups together, played lots, bonded extremely well and I certainly surprised Caroline at how well I took to motherhood. Before Evan's birth she had said I would probably be climbing the walls by 6 months wanting to get back to work and I have to admit I think I surprised myself a little too. I am looking forward to seeing my friends at work and also doing something which is non-baby related but I just wish there could have been a way for me to spend a little more time with Evan than I am going to have when I go back to work. My ideal solution would be to work 3 days and have 2 days off with Evan so that he can have me all to himself. Maybe when Caroline is earning and we have a little brother or sister for Evan I'll be able to work part time.  

I attended a developmental session aimed at letting us know what to expect between the ages of 6-9 months. I learnt a lot about the kinds of foods we can start letting Evan have and they even said that he should soon be able to feed himself. I decided to try a few out this week with varying degrees of success! We placed some peas and sweetcorn on his highchair tray and watched to see if he could pick them up and eat them by himself. I don't think he realised they were food and instead just happily mashed his hands down on them and sprayed bits of pea and sweetcorn across the living room. No doubt I'll continue to find bits of pea for the next couple of days when cleaning! Caroline also gave Evan the spoon and helped him feed himself and this was a little more successful. He just got bored after a few spoonfuls and then started flapping his hands around in protest.  

We have also started brushing his teeth twice a day and hopeful by the time the teeth are out far enough to need cleaning properly, he'll be used to the toothbrush and this routine. The first few attempts were a failure because he objected to the bristles of the brush going in his mouth and in the end I had to use my finger. Gradually over the week he has learned that this needs to be done and he is actually starting to open his mouth for us, albeit for just a few seconds at a time before clamping shut again! I let him play with the brush afterwards though and he seems to enjoy sticking it in his mouth then... :)  

Evan has had his pre-sessions with the nursery this week. He attended 3 introductory 2 hour sessions to get him used to the environment and the people working with him. I was there for the first 2 sessions with him but on the third and final session he remained with the nursery on his own. I think it was harder for me than it was for him. I spent the first day worrying about what could be dangerous for Evan and worrying how they might cope with issues they may have feeding him or getting him to sleep etc.. He seemed to be fine and played quite happily. I am not sure how well his routine will fit in with the nursery's routine but time will tell. I was all psyched up for my first day back at work but as the looms closer and closer, my nerves and that anxious feeling that I get when away from Evan gets stronger and stronger... I have no idea how I will cope...  

Evan and I had a clumsy day this week :(. He decided to bounce up and down on his knees in front of the coffee table and eye-butted the table giving himself a nasty bruise underneath his eye. That very same day I was bringing Evan down the stairs after having his evening bath and I slipped on a yellow pages that my neighbour had lent me, I dropped the nappy in my left hand and landed on that arm as I slipped down the stairs but unfortunately as my body weight shifted I still managed to squash Evan's left leg between my bum and the stairs as I came to a halt. Caroline heard my scream and was there before I even finished calling her name. I don't know how much of my weight landed on Evan and I have no idea how I managed to keep hold of him as we fell. The poor little guy has a big lump on his knee that was trapped and a big red patch. I was devastated and hated seeing him cry. Causing pain to your child is probably a mothers worst nightmare and I still feel guilty thinking about it blaming myself for putting something on the stairs in the first place! I called the NHS Direct telephone service and talking through with them all the checks I did afterwards, I don't think he has any broken bones, just a few bruises. I just wanted to cuddle him all night long after that, but the poor little guy was tired and needed his bed. I am just glad he was due a bottle as that was one of the things that helped us calm him down after such a traumatic event. I know this is probably the first of many bumps and bruises he is going to get now that he is mobile, but I just hope that I never hurt him again.. poor baby boy.</value>

  <data name="y1w40One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When I started preparing myself for the inevitable return to work, nothing I thought up actually came close to comparing to the real deal! I was hoping that I would be kept really busy to keep my mind off of Evan. My work did ok on that part except for not having my own PC for my first day back, I'll forgive them for that as they gave me a brand new shiny lush PC the very next day. I did think a lot about Evan and I think I only telephoned them once in his first week so that's not bad.  

Going on our experiences at the introduction sessions I thought Evan would fit in just fine, How wrong I could be.... He seemed ok when I dropped him off and he is eating fantastically well at nursery. The problems arrive when it is time to sleep. Evan is used to his own bed and it's fairly quiet at home. Nursery is completely different, there are 6 cots in one room, so you are likely to have more than one baby sleeping at any one time. We even take Gerry the Giraffe in every morning straight out of Evan's cot to try and give it that homely feel. We are lucky if he gets 1 hour and a half throughout the whole day so by the time I get there of an evening to collect him, he's shattered and grumpy. At home Evan would usually sleep for around 2 hours in the morning and then an hour or so in the afternoon. I just didn't think that maybe he wouldn't be able to sleep at nursery, I thought it would take him a while to get used to the cot but eventually he would still be able to sleep. Of course I forgot that he would be sharing with other babies and would likely get woken up a lot more.  

The first 2 days were probably the hardest for me. When I went to collect Evan, he just looked at me and pulled this face as if he were going to cry and even his voice had a quiver in it. He was breathing as though he had just cried for hours. It was so traumatic, he held his arms up to me and crawled towards me crying. Apparently he was fine up until then, it must have been the sight of seeing me that set him off. I always imagined him being pleased to see me but not in this kind of way, like he had almost given up hope of seeing me and then finally I arrived. I could have cried there with him but instead we shared a tight embrace. In the evening now Evan follows me everywhere and has been crying as soon as I put him down, it's as if he is worried I am going to leave him again.  

I did enjoy parts of being back at work, I just wish my day away from Evan wasn't as long. I think working shorter days and still being able to spend some time with Evan would suit me more than working all day long and having no time with him during the week. I was so pleased to see the weekend arrive, though I was extremely tired because there is no such thing as a lie-in. Evan didn't appreciate being woken up at 6.30am every morning and by the time the weekend came along, he was ready to get up at around 7am.  

Evan used to love going out places and he still does love his pushchair, although the car seat is another issue completely. I started to notice halfway through the week that whenever I put Evan in his car seat, he would just scream and fight, desperate to get out. I am starting to think that maybe he knows that he is going to nursery and now whenever I take him out in the car, he fights me.  It's a real shame because he really did love going out in the car.  

I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend with Evan, Caroline handled all the food shopping, whilst I took Evan out with me. We went to our local Leisure Centre where there is an indoor play area called "Cheeky Charlie's". It's split into two sections, one for the 'under 3's' and one for the 'over 3's'. At first Evan was very scared as it was quite loud and hectic with lots of children running around jumping into the ball pits and climbing everything. I couldn't let go of Evan for at least 10 minutes at first because otherwise he would just cry, by the end of it he was trying to crawl to all the places where the over 3's were playing! We didn't have to pay for entry because Evan is not yet walking, but he still enjoyed it.  

Evan did something new this weekend for us. I was standing in the kitchen looking through the doorway at Evan. He was kneeling up at his playpen looking in towards it *(he wasn't inside it).* He suddenly moved his left leg so that his foot was flat against the floor and then he just stood up whilst holding the playpen bars for balance. I just couldn't believe my eyes, he's only been crawling for 2 weeks and now suddenly he can stand! He wobbles a bit, but he was able to stand for several minutes before flopping back down onto his bum. It's lovely to see his development first hand, missing his first's of things is one of my greatest fears now that I have returned to work.  

I hope he'll always want my cuddles even though we won't be around each other all day, everyday. I have thoroughly enjoyed my maternity leave with him and I hope I have no regrets in years to come. I love being Evan's mummy.</value>

    <value>If someone had told me beforehand about the events that would happen this week I probably would have laughed. I had just completed my first week back at work after 10 months off and when I go into Evan on Sunday morning this week, his eye is oozing with puss. I tried to keep the eye clean but within minutes of wiping it, the infectious gunk had returned. I was sure Evan needed to see a Doctor so I sent a mobile text to warn my boss that I wouldn't be in on Monday. Little did I realise that this would actually end up being the whole week! I'd only just been back at work for 1 week, that I would then need to have a whole week off unpaid! All this happened right after we'd just been given a motivational speech about doing everything we possibly could to meet our tight deadline. The thing is... My family will always come first...  

My fears were confirmed when I managed to see a nurse on Monday, Evan had an eye infection. She prescribed some eye drops that needed to be put into the affected eye(s) 4 times a day!?!? I have struggled giving medicine to cats before and I expect putting eye drops in a baby's eye is just as difficult. I managed a couple of times to apply the drops on my own whilst Caroline was at University but it was definitely much easier and less stressful for Evan when we were both on hand for this particular procedure. He cried and wriggled his head from side to side kicking his legs into the abdomen of the person trying to administer the drops. He clamped his eyes shut that we had to prise his eyelid open, it was traumatic for us all. He's a clever boy though, he knew when we were going to do it and he would start stiffening out his limbs in protest. By the afternoon of the first day the infection had spread to his other eye.  

This was such bad timing as that evening we had to drive to London to visit Evan's Grandma in hospital. My mum had an operation over the weekend that had complications. It felt like deja-vu all over again as everything that happened to Caroline all those months ago was now happening to my mum. She ended up having 2 operations because the Doctor left a hole in her in the first one and she also had to spend a night in intensive care because she was having trouble breathing.  

I used a route planner on the internet to try and work out my route to the hospital and evening though we were travelling all the way across London, it should only take about an hour, maybe an hour and a half at the most. How wrong could I be? 3 hours later we arrived in East London, 15 minutes after visiting time had ended only to find out that Evan wasn't actually allowed in the hospital. We got lost because it was so difficult to follow the instructions and it was too dark to read the road signs. I think we circled Tower Hamlets a couple of times and actually crossed The River Thames 8 times in our attempts to find this hospital. Luckily the staff in the hospital knew we were running late and allowed us to see my mum and my aunt who happened to be staying with her met us in reception to baby sit Evan who's eyes at this point were looking awful. After everything I went through with Caroline, you would have thought I would be used to seeing people in hospital but unfortunately my squeamish nature came out in force. It was awful seeing my mum vulnerable and weak and I found it very hard to keep myself composed without feeling queasy. I am thankful that Caroline was there to be my strength.  

By Thursday Evan's eyes were looking worse and this time when I contacted the Doctor's Surgery I requested that I saw a proper Doctor. He took a swab for testing and informed us that the infection that Evan had was resistant to the eye drops as they should have cleared it up within 48 hours. Instead he prescribed some oral antibiotics - what a relief, this would be so much easier to administer. The antibiotics were powder based but luckily it tasted like oranges so Evan didn't mind taking this 3 times a day. These new antibiotics did the trick as his eye was looking much better by Friday morning already. This was good news for me as Evan needed to be clear of the infection for 24 hours before the nursery would let him return so Monday was looking like a good date.  

Our new stair gate arrived this week whilst I was off work looking after Evan. We had to buy a stair gate that would actually be fitted to the wall and not one of these easy to fit *(no screws)* gate because our stair gate was going at the top of the stairs. I decided to go for a gate that opened like a door and not one that had a middle section that was the door. My reason for this is that I didn't want a bar going across the bottom that I could trip over and I also wanted a bigger opening so that carrying things up and down would be easier with more space. We don't really do DIY but I decided to have a go at fitting this contraption. I swear it was the killer stair gate from hell! It took me an hour just to assemble the door portion and then I managed to screw the hinges into the banister upright in the wrong position. In the end I asked my neighbour across the road to help. He's built his own house extension and they are expecting a baby any day soon so I knew he would know what to do. He had to redo everything that I had already done and even then the stair gate didn't want to cooperate. Lots of holes later and we finally have a secure stair gate keeping Evan protected whilst he is upstairs with us.  

Evan had a new toy delivered this week to aide him with his standing. We bought him an activity table from vtech. It has lots of things for him to interact with, but my only issue with it is that it is too light. Evan has no trouble pushing it around and at the moment he is going through a rough phase where he likes to bash and throw his toys around. So many times he keeps trying to tip it over or whack it into the patio door windows! He does play with it properly when I sit and interact with him, I find him like that with most of his toys but I still think it is worth it. He does still attempt to stand up using tables and chairs but occasionally he will choose the safer option of the activity table. I know all babies get bumps and bruises but it is awful when it happens. Evan was playing with a coaster next to Caroline and I as we were sitting on the floor whilst he stood by the table. He dropped the coaster and immediately dropped to the floor to get it - I tire to stop him. The only problem is that he didn't move away from the table and he face butted the top of the table before I could stop him. The cries! The red mark showed immediately and we managed to get a cold flannel on his face fairly quickly - though I think that in itself was annoying Evan. My poor little bruiser boy :(, this won't be the last time and I am just going to have to make sure that mummy is there with open arms when he bumps himself next time whilst playing.</value>

  <data name="y1w42One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan and I actually settled back into our work routine fairly quickly this time round. I was certain that we would have problems reintroducing Evan to nursery as Evan was only there for one week before being off sick for a week with me. I am glad that this was not the case though. He seemed fine and actually started sleeping a bit better in the day time at nursery this week.  

My mum was released from hospital this week, but not even 24 hours later when she had a visit from her GP, they decided to send her back to hospital again because her breathing was not good enough. She was only in Surrey Hospital 3 days before the decided that she should be transferred to London so that the Doctor who did the damage to her could fix her! Is that allowed?!?! An NHS Hospital deciding that they can't be bothered to treat a patient and that they should be treated by the original Doctor who messed up the initial operations.. This whole fiasco coupled with the events Caroline went through a few months ago has actually made me very wary of Hospital's these days.  

We took a trip to Southend this weekend to see Caroline's mum and our friends Mel and James. This was the first trip away in the new family car and I have no idea how we managed when we did use the Clio because I still managed to fill this much bigger car full. It probably didn't help that I also had a boxed highchair in the back with us for Caroline's mum.  

We had arranged with the Grandmas that it was getting difficult to feed Evan whilst visiting them and that they should both invest in a highchair that we could use at their homes. They both agreed... Well that was until we mentioned it on the telephone this week when arranging to visit Caroline's mum, she had decided that it was a waste of money and she didn't want to buy a highchair. She would just show us how she managed without a highchair when she had twins 50 years ago! We were both really angry because Evan can be a little git when it comes to feeding. If he gets distracted or doesn't want to eat, he will arch his back and protest with his arms flapping around. I should have let her try and then she probably would have been cleaning dried up crusty beef and potato off of her walls and furniture for the next 6 months :).  

I just didn't want the hassle, so I decided that I would drive into town the next day and buy one. If I had had a few more days notice, I probably would have ordered it online to be delivered but we only had 1 days notice so that was out of the question. I didn't really think this through and it wasn't until I had bought the highchair and was sitting in the waiting chairs at my local Argos that it suddenly dawned on me... How on earth was I going to carry a highchair across town whilst I had Evan in his pushchair?! The highchair was too big to go into a bag and I was left there standing with this big box wondering what the hell I was going to do. I am sure people were looking at me in interest thinking the same thoughts. I had a brainwave! I sat Evan on the floor in Argos and I had to give him my mobile phone to stop him from crawling off. I put the bags from earlier in the shopping basket part of the pushchair and I managed to balance the highchair box on the seated portion of his pushchair leaning up towards the handlebar. I then picked Evan up and in one arm and pushed the pushchair along with the other hand. Just think if I'd had a pushchair with two handles, there would be no way I could have achieved that! It was a long and painful walk back to the car but Evan loves being in my arms looking around so he was as good as gold. The only issue I had was that my left arm is much weaker than my right and I can't hold Evan for too long in that arm. By the time I got back to the car (thankfully I found a space on one of the ground floor parking areas for mum and baby) my arms were really hurting and I was absolutely knackered.. Damn you Nanny, damn you! :)</value>

  <data name="y1w43One" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan absolutely adores the cats and he just won't leave them alone now. If he is on the floor and they come into view, he's off, following them around laughing and being generally noisy. He doesn't mean to scare them, he just wants to be able to touch them. The problem is, he is quite heavy handed and also very loud and excitable around them that it just scares them. If we are there to help him stroke them, it's ok, but most of the time he just follows them as they are just that little too quick for him. He'll follow them right up to the cat flap. They disappear outside and his attention then turns to the cat flap and he'll just sit there pushing it open! Meal times are usually quite funny if Evan is still awake. He eats his dinner earlier whilst at nursery so we tend to eat at the table with him playing on the floor next to us and when Cleo (one of our cats) sits next to us begging, Evan turns his attention to her and they will just go round in circles around the table.  

Evan is generally more vocal and loud these days, though we still don't have real words yet. The closest we have is *"splash".* Every evening when we bath Evan all I have to say is *Evan, splash Mummy"* or *"splash, splash"* and he knows exactly what I mean. He will launch into this tirade of kicks and splat his hands down into the water causing some tremendous splashes. If he gets his whole body bouncing, it turns into a wave that can actually pour over the edge of the bath drowning me and the bathroom in the process. Well this week he actually started to copy me and he says something that sounds like splash but it's actually more like: *"stash, stash".*  

Evan is more into his silly sounds *(just like me)* than into actual words. His says *"da da"* a lot and *"yah yah".* All those daddy's that think babies say "daddy" first are misinformed, it must just be a natural progression onto sounds that makes babies say *"da da"* because we've never mentioned the daddy word and even Evan knows how to say it :), so I am pretty sure he has no idea what he is saying when he says *"da da".* The sounds that he is making are really quite funny and usually make me laugh lots or attempt to mimic him. He can do this kind of cool growl that sounds like *"gaaahhhhh"* or *"aaaagghhhh"* but saying it in the back of your throat so it's all husky and growl like. This week he started clucking with his tongue and I have no idea where he picked that up from because neither Caroline or I have made that noise in front of him before.  

I haven't really sat down with him repeating words to him and showing him objects along with the word but I have started doing that a little more. When we play with the ball or the stacking cups, I'll reference the word ball and cup a lot. I have no idea if I am doing the right thing but together we'll learn eventually.  

A memorable event this week was getting Evan his first pair of shoes. He hasn't worn any footwear to date and he found the introduction of shoes to his feet very bizarre. We only use them outside when he is playing at nursery, though he is *"wearing them in"* in one of the pictures this week. It was funny at first because he spent ages just grabbing them, then he tried to eat them and now finally he can just about cope with them on his feet whilst crawling. Standing and walking with our help is more tricky as they make his feet feel heavier than what he was previously used to.</value>

    <value>This was my 5th week back at work and it was another chaotic one. Evan already had a cough and I just put it down to the start of Autumn and that it was just something minor. By the time Sunday came though, Evan was sleeping lots and not as playful as usual. Throughout the night Evan's coughing became worse that it actually woke the whole house up several times and I was having to get up to calm him every 45 minutes or so. This prompted Caroline to move her bed downstairs. Evan and I still made it into nursery and work respectively but the reports I had from the nursery staff made me realise that Evan was pretty poorly. Of all the days for us to have bad traffic, some traffic lights were out near the nursery and as a result it took me almost an hour to collect Evan and then just over and hour for us to get home from the nursery. Evan was tired and unwell and whilst the car was stationery, he just cried and grizzled. There was nothing I could do or say to comfort him and I was pleased for him when he finally fell asleep... poor baby. He had developed a fever and it was extremely difficult to get an accurate temperature, but it was coming out as 39 degrees. A Bath, bottle and a dose of Calpol later, Evan was tucked up in bed.  

Monday night was as bad as the previous night with me getting up to Evan every 30 minutes. I'd bought some cough medicine earlier in the day hoping that it would help him through the night. I ended up giving him his bottle of milk at 1.30am and that sent him off into a deep sleep allowing us a few hours rest. I worked from home on Tuesday and Evan spent most of the day sleeping. He wouldn't eat anything and would only take bottles of milk before falling back to sleep. His temperature was back to normal so I believed we were through the worst of it. I finished work late that day because I was working with a client in the US and I was exhausted by the end of it. I was due to go and watch a local football match and in the end I went to bed with the shivers myself.  

The nights are hard when you have a child that is ill, but they are even harder when you are ill yourself. Caroline was keeping her distance as it was the last thing that she needed after everything she had been through lately. Wednesday was probably the worst day. With Evan not eating solids, it was important that he drank some milk and fluids. However, on Wednesday evening he vomited all his milk from the evening feed all over me. Our clothes went straight in the washing machine and we went under the shower. 3am Thursday morning and he vomited again, all over me and we were once again back under the shower. Miraculously none of the vomit touched the floor, my clothes managed to soak it all up. My poor baby, his nose was blocked completely and his cough was much worse. His temperature had returned with a vengeance and this time he was breathing very rapidly. After a conversation with the NHS Direct, they got a Doctor to call me back. I had to give Evan a sponge bath to help his temperature come down (this was the reason he was breathing rapidly) and then I was told to give him a double dose of Calpol to help with his fever.  

I managed to get him a Doctor's appointment on Thursday and they discovered that he had bronchitis and an ear infection. They prescribed him some banana flavoured antibiotics that stained his skin leaving him with a yellowish moustache! The Doctor warned me that it is quite common for babies with bronchitis to be admitted to hospital where they can be monitored and given fluid. If Evan hadn't shown signs of getting better by the end of the day *(after 3 doses of the antibiotics)* he would have been admitted. This was my worst nightmare, at the moment everyone around me who goes into hospital ends up in worse condition so I really didn't want this to happen. Apparently the coughing and bringing up catarrh causes babies to vomit and that can lead to dehydration. Luckily for us all Evan's temperature was back to normal and he was a lot better by Thursday evening.  

He still refused to eat on Friday but I was able to feed him a banana on Saturday and Sunday. Unfortunately, the inevitable happened and Caroline caught my cold by the end of the week. So this week has been full of sneezes, coughs and colds for all of us... bring on next week!</value>

    <value>Evan is fully recovered from his bronchitis and he also regained his big appetite this week. Caroline and I still have the remnants of our colds but I am just glad that Evan is ok.  

Evan can really object to things when he wants to. We think he'll be a "foot stamper" for sure when he has tantrums when he is older. He already swings his arms and bounces on his legs! Sometimes the only thing I can do to get his attention is to give him something new as a distraction. Handing him a toy does nothing apart from give him some ammo to launch across the room. Evan loves shiny things and if they flash or make noises the better, he likes his bling! The other week I gave Evan my mobile phone and used the landline to make a call to it. I tried it first with just the ring and then the second time I put the mobile phone on vibrate mode. He was definitely more interested in the phone when it rang.  

My mobile phone is one of the few things that works as a distraction when Evan is having a tantrum. My keys or a wooden spoon can sometimes work but a mobile phone or a remote control work every time. This week Evan surprised me with his deft touch as he managed to do the following with my mobile:  

 - Switch it off *(It was on when I gave it to him as he loves the blue flashing light)*
 - Switch it back on *(he came unstuck with the pin, so I had to enter it before he had me locked out of my phone)*
 - He was then able to access my recent calls list using the green phone button and then promptly dialled the number I had last called
 - He was also quite good at dialling random numbers, luckily he could only manage about 3 numbers before pressing the dial button

I then decided that I didn't want to play that game anymore so I took the phone away from him, which led to a huge cry and another tantrum, doh!  

Evan likes to stand up a lot more now and he is now getting more coordinated when I help him walk holding his hands. One of our favourite times at the moment is on Saturday evenings. We let Evan stay up a bit later than usual so that we can all spend some quality time together as a family. We've been watching the X-factor recently and Evan likes it when I sit on the floor with him and he stands between my legs, holding my hands while he bounces and jigs along to the music.  

The fireworks disrupted Evan's routine this week. Friday 4th November was probably the worst around our area and in the end we had to get Evan up and bring him downstairs until the majority of the fireworks had been let off. The bangs were so loud that they scared me so I am not surprised that he couldn't sleep. He stood up at the patio window watching them but was easily distracted by other events going on inside the house.</value>

    <value>We've had some major achievements this week with Evan. He can now stand on his own without holding on for long periods of time. This has happened ever so quickly, at first it was just a second or two before flopping to the floor. By the end of the week he was able to stand for 22 seconds!  

I think sometimes he doesn't realise he is doing it. He'll be holding onto the table or me playing with a toy. He will then grasp the toy with both hands, standing alone. He then has this startled look as he suddenly realises he is not holding on. It's as if he then tells himself that his legs can't do this because he suddenly falls forward onto me or just drops onto his bum. He is much more stable in general these days. He can quite happily lower himself slowly to the floor from a standing position.  

He did attempt to walk this week. We were in the bathroom one evening running the bath. He was watching the bath fill as he always does and he turned around and looked at me. He suddenly just launched himself towards me but for some reason his legs didn't quite do the walking and I ended up catching him!  

Evan's grandma bought Evan a musical xylophone last month but I think Evan was a little too young for it back then as he was more interest in eating the wood - yuk! We decided to get it out a week or so ago and he is really getting into it now. He knows exactly what to do and his coordination with the sticks is great. He's not the next Mozart yet and hits them really hard so it usually makes you want to wear ear plugs. His other mummy doesn't appreciate this kind of noise when she is studying, especially when he gets bored and decides to whack the sticks on the laminated flooring instead...  

Another favourite toy of Evan's at the moment is a tennis ball. He rolls it along the floor and just chases it around giggling as he goes. It makes a cool sound on the laminated flooring in our study and it travels really fast.  

Evan started licking his lips this week! We had chicken fajitas earlier in the week and Evan kept pulling himself up onto his feet next to the table grizzling. I soon realised that it was my food he was after. He had already eaten his dinner at nursery so he doesn't eat with us when we get home. I gave him some guacamole, but he wasn't too impressed with that. I then tried him on some crème fraiche and he loved it. It went all over his mouth and he surprised us both when he stuck his tongue out and started licking his lips.  

We have a new trick at feeding time now. For a while now we have been giving Evan a spoon to hold whilst we feed him because otherwise he can be really difficult to feed. He's always putting his empty spoon in his mouth but this week I started saying "give mummy spoon" and then opening my mouth for him and he turns the spoon around to me and pushes it into my mouth, well sometimes the aim is a little off and he ends up jabbing my cheek or nose. I then say *"yum yum"* and he loves it. I am not sure he'll be feeding himself anytime soon as he doesn't really have the concept of gently doing anything just yet so I'll just continue to let him practice on me.</value>

    <value>As the sayings go *"You wait hours for a bus and then 3 come along at once"*, or *"bad things always happen in three's"*. Well, this week we had our third illness with Evan. I had noticed towards the end of last week that he was pooing a lot more than usual and it was getting rather smelly. Over the weekend it peaked and Evan did about 6 poos in one day. I took him to nursery on the Monday and told them I was worried and that I would be contacting a Doctor that day. By the time I collected him, his poor little bottom was incredibly sore and he'd done another 6 that day as well. The nursery decided that he wasn't well enough to attend nursery so Evan had my company for the next couple of days whilst the diarrhoea cleared up. I took him to the Doctor and she seemed quite pleased with his progress and was happy his body was fighting the virus, so we weren't given any medication this time. With all the pooing, Evan has lost a little weight so he's not my porky little boy anymore. Fortunately I only had to take 2 days off unpaid this week so hopefully I'll have enough money at the end of the month to buy Evan's birthday and Christmas presents.  

When we decorated Evan's bedroom whilst I was pregnant, we bought some lovely *(rather expensive)* bedroom furniture to go in our little bedroom. Evan was a naughty little boy this week as he has started to chew his cot. I can't seem to stop him either and it's not just little teeth marks, it's full on chewing with bits of wood missing! I made him cry when I told him that was naughty so I felt terribly guilty because he has no idea what he has done. I've tried putting one of those soft toys that are like a snake that loop round the bars but that hasn't distracted him. In the end I resorted to tying muslins around the bars to stop him from being able to reach the wood. I have no doubts he'll eventually find another way to chew it. After mentioning it to people I work with, it appears Evan is the only little child that chews and eats inedible objects like wood...  

Evan is making good progress on his feet and I could kick myself for what I showed him this week. You just want to help your child develop and learn things. This week I was playing with Evan and we were following the cat upstairs so instead of just carrying him up, I showed him how to climb the stairs. I didn't think anything of it until 2 days later the cat headed up the stairs and Evan followed her! We were right there with him but it just goes to show how quickly our children can learn to do things. We are ok at the moment because we are hardly ever out by the stairs, but I may have to consider getting another stair gate to keep Evan safe at the bottom of the stairs because his balance on the steps wasn't great and he slipped a few times.  

Evan's hair over recent weeks has been getting really long and this week we decided enough was enough, we would have to cut it. I was in two minds as to what to do, I didn't want it to look like a hashed job, which obviously looked like his mummy had been let loose on him and not a professional. We thought about using hair clippers and then just letting it grow back, but that seemed quite drastic and he does have lovely blonde hair. Plus my mum mentioned he might not like the sound of it, especially so close to his body. My friend Nathalie visited us this week with her son Alex as it's been a while since we managed to spend some time together. She told us how she cut Alex's hair so we decided that it wouldn't be too hard if we used the same methods of distraction. We cut half of his hair when we did the evening bottle and we managed to get a little bit of the other side done as well, but not all of it. The following day, we finished it off at bath time whilst I let Evan play with my mobile phone. I actually think we have done a pretty good job, it's not harsh straight lines, we have tried to give him the scruffy trendy look!   

We witnessed Nathalie's son Alex walking properly for the first time this week. For some reason he was really into everything at our house, maybe it was the change of environment. I was getting some toys out for them to play with and he just walked over to me. It was surreal and a really great experience to witness. The cats were indoors because the weather was windy outside and Evan and Alex wouldn't leave them alone, they had to hide on top of the scratching post out of the reach of little baby hands. Alex walked twice that afternoon and from what Nathalie told me, later that evening Alex was walking everywhere to show his daddy too! I hope I am around when Evan takes his first real confident steps without my help.</value>

    <value>We had one funny incident with Evan this week. We were out doing our weekly shop and the lady at the McDonalds inside Asda gave us this balloon tied onto a plastic stick for Evan to play with. I thought it would be ok under supervision so I let him play with it and he happily banged it around all over the place, giggling when he inadvertently bonked it against either my head or his own.  

The balloon was still in the house one evening when we arrived home and we were playing with it again in front of Evan. Caroline decided to show him how it deflated making a funny noise. I wasn't sure how Evan would react but he absolutely hated it, he cried every time we let the balloon deflate. I tried to hand him the balloon to feel the texture and this made him cry even more, pulling a scared face and jerking his body away from the balloon. When I did get the balloon to touch his skin, he just cried even more and he was inconsolable. I couldn't seem to calm him down until we had blown the balloon back up and placed it back on the plastic stick. As soon as it was back to how it was Evan stopped crying and started to play with it again. It was a totally bizarre reaction that I was not expecting. I guess Evan doesn't like deflated balloons, especially the act of deflating it. He has always been a bit scared of strange noises.  

He did attempt to eat the balloon when it was on the stick and I had to stop him because I certainly didn't want him to burst the balloon like that.  

The first of Evan's presents arrived this week in the post for Christmas and his Birthday. I am glad I opened the packages straight away to check because I'd been sent the wrong item. I was expecting a Toddler Wobble Ride On, but instead we received some baby soft mat with play gym! Evan was really interested in the box of Duplo Lego that we've bought and he actually managed to get the lid off and started playing with them. I then had to wait until he was asleep before hiding them because I dare not take a toy from Evan that he is playing with because it really upsets him.</value>

    <value>I was playing with Evan this week after his evening bath and he escaped my grasp as I was drying him. I just let him sit a few feet away bouncing happily on his feet as he knelt down. I was playing with his little bath cups and I started gently tossing them into the air so that they fell all over the floor and he was beside himself, in extreme giggles. I started to laugh because he was. He was laughing so much I could see his eyes watering. I carried on playing with the cups when suddenly I smelt it. No way could a baby fart however silent and deadly could smell that bad and sure enough I peered round Evans naked body only to see a massive poo. *"Oh nooooo...."* I gasped trying not to laugh but also desperately hoping that Caroline wouldn't see us. I'd already been told off before for letting Evan go around naked for too long. Luckily the way Evan was positioned balanced on his legs as he knelt, the poo escaped his clean body *(apart from the bottom of course)* but it looked decidedly like a slugs trail because he must have poo'd as he bounced along in a fit of giggles.. Now I've heard of laughing so much that you pee yourself but... goodness me... poo?  

Evan is obsessed with stacking blocks, cups and placing things inside each other and his favourite thing to play with at change time has always been the tub of sudocrem. The tub is nearly empty and this week Evan managed to get hold of it whilst I was draining his bath. He'd not only poked his fingers all in the stuff and then touched everything by the time I got to him to reclaim it, he had also managed to place one of his bath cups inside for safe keeping. Now sporting a new white coat of course!</value>

    <value>We have a new member of the family and Evan absolutely adores him. His name is Noodle and he's Caroline's early Christmas present. He's really little and Evan *(although harmless)* scares him because his movements are so loud and jerky.  

I had a half day this week to attend Evan's nativity play. Evan was forming part of the rainbow and his colour was yellow. I had to provide yellow clothes for him to wear, I couldn't find yellow trousers so in the end he wore cream trousers and a yellow t-shirt. They also made these little rambo-like headbands in the appropriate colour. They sang the rainbow song whilst Evan was on the stage and he spent most of his time looking at the balloons floating in the room and clapping at us. It was really cute and I would have had some decent pictures to show if the nursery hadn't insisted that cameras were banned.  

We went Christmas shopping in Guildford this weekend though we didn't really end up buying much as I bought most of the presents this year online. We decided to go shopping near to where my mum lives so that she could baby sit Evan for the day, so we headed off to Guildford to do our shopping this year. The trip was a huge success, Evan slept in his travel cot and we stayed for a lovely dinner. My mum is still recovering from her operation and was unable to carry Evan up the stairs but with a little improvising and some help from Evan, he managed to climb the stairs by himself with my mum walking up behind him.</value>

    <value>We popped over to our next door neighbour this week to deliver our Christmas card and we decided to give her a bottle of wine as a thank you for all the help we have had from her. We decided to stay for a glass of wine to catch up and she was very fortunate to witness a first time event from Evan. He's certainly not shy in new places and was crawling and playing all over her lounge floor being a little cutie as usual.  

Evan stood up and suddenly started to walk around in a circle whilst we all clapped and encouraged him. He did this several times and it was an amazing experience for us all. He just needs a little more confidence on his feet allowing him to do more steps.  

This was Evan's final week at nursery so they had a Christmas party for the children with a magician and a present for everyone. They had a little disco for the older children, but even Evan managed to have a little boogie with the nursery staff holding him. They had already asked me a few days earlier if it would be ok for Evan to eat the party food being provided for their afternoon meal.  

I reluctantly agreed but I told them about all the issues I had experienced with Evan choking and when they mentioned the kinds of foods that he would be eating... Sausage rolls, pizza pieces, spring rolls, vegetable sticks etc.. it gave me nightmares every night.  

I was worried how he would cope with those kinds of foods as he had never experienced them before. He always struggles with toast and scrambled egg so I had no idea how he would cope with pizza and sausage rolls. I was teased by my mum and Caroline and my mum even joked that she wouldn't be surprised if I suddenly fell ill on Tuesday morning *(the day of the party)* and didn't take Evan into nursery - shame on them! Evan did go to the party and I did go to work that day! I was adamant that my fears would not deprive Evan of an experience - I just had to make sure that I wasn't there to witness it as my panicking would be unbearable. I'd made it clear that he could choke and that I was stressed about it and the nursery staff were really nice about it. I took along a spare meal just in case he didn't eat the food they provided. He does eat lumps, it's just I have had little success with this kind of food in the past and it has made me nervous.  

Evan did absolutely fine and he loved the food; he only choked the once. He was picking the food up and placing it in his mouth and the only thing he wasn't too fussed about was a raw carrot stick. He took one bite and then spat it out and threw the stick on the floor!  

Since then we have had successes on the food front with crumpets and pancakes - he loved the pancakes.</value>

    <value>This was Evan's last week in his first year and it's amazing how quickly time flies by when watching your baby grow into a little boy. This final week started with a birthday party for Alex - one of Evan's baby buddies. We managed to get most of the gang together for one final meet before Christmas and it was lovely. All the babies are walking now, though Evan is still very wobbly and he would still prefer to crawl at times where as the others are very much mobile and walking very steadily. His first steps were taken in the presence of both Caroline and myself one evening just before bed time. We would position Evan at one end of the lounge with Caroline and then I would take several steps away and encourage him to walk to me. Most of the time he would just drop to his knees and crawl over super fast. However one evening this week, he just walked, we couldn't believe our eyes. We managed to capture 24 steps from Evan on the video camera and it was amazing.  

I dragged Caroline along to the local park this week so that we could film Evan on the swings. We chose a bitterly cold Sunday morning and the wind was whistling loudly as we filmed. Evan loved the swings though and we got some very good *(noisy)* camera footage.

Caroline was looking after Evan for the first part of this week as I was still working hard at work. They had a great time together, shopping and just general bonding. I have to say Caroline is doing so much better with the whole feeding aspect of being a parent than I am. Evan has scared me so many times with choking on lumps that I really struggle to stay composed whilst feeding him something tricky. Caroline actually threw me out of the room this week because she was feeding him a cheesy omelette for breakfast and it was one of the lumpiest feeds we have probably had recently. Evan coped quite well, but every time he pulled that face with a little gag it made me panic. In the end I had to leave the room and go to work because I was unbearable. Caroline actually filmed him eating a biscuit this day *(a food I struggle to get him to eat)* to prove to me that Evan can now bite and chew properly...  

We were wrapping Evan's Christmas and Birthday presents one evening whilst watching some TV this week. I had two piles of presents, one for his birthday and the other for Christmas and we planned to just put them all under the tree for him. I am not sure what happened next *(we must have been on a roll)* but they all ended up being wrapped in Christmas paper and then had Christmas tags on them! I did manage to make a home made birthday tag for the present that didn't have a tag and it looked really nice.  

We prepared a lovely Christmas dinner for all our visitors and we even had Evan sitting at the head of the table in his high chair with a bowl of Christmas dinner for him too. He struggled with the turkey and sprouts but loved the potatoes, carrots and gravy. We even managed to get him to wear a Christmas hat out of a cracker for about 3 seconds before he ripped it off!  

I wanted to show Evan the 3 S's in his first year - *(sand, sea and snow)*. We managed the sand and sea when we visited the beach earlier in the year and unfortunately the snow arrived a day after his birthday, but I still see that as a success. We were sitting at the table eating breakfast with Evan when the snow blizzard just hit us and Evan was truly mesmerised by these huge flakes dropping to the ground outside. I didn't managed to get him outside in time for the big flakes, but we did take him out side for a few minutes after breakfast but it wasn't as cool as if we'd been surrounded by the huge flakes dropping from the skies. Hopefully it will snow again and will be able to get some great pictures of Evan enjoying it.

I started thinking back to last year a lot from Christmas Eve all the way through to Boxing Day. I was getting vivid memories of my labour experiences in hospital and when I actually mentioned it to my mum and Caroline, they too had been remembering as well.  

We have had a fantastic and entertaining first year with Evan and I am so glad to have documented my experiences here. Evan is now a little boy and I think his growing and development will slow down throughout the coming year. As a result I plan to change his updates to be monthly to ensure that I have something interesting to write about. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</value>
