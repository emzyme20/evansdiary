    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>My experience of the birth is totally different to that of Caroline's. When I think back, parts of it are now starting to blur and I need reminding from those that were present to relive certain events. I guess the pain relief through drugs and that of my natural pain relief are part of the reasons for me not remembering it. I personally handled being pregnant and going through the labour better than I would have handled being the partner who felt completely helpless at times.
    
For two days I was having contractions and I really thought I was doing really well to have lasted with just the TENs machine. I wasn't at the time aware that my waters hadn't fully broken. When I was examined on Christmas Day and the midwife told me that I hadn't dilated at all I was devastated. All I could think of was that the pain I was having was obviously going to get worse. I have never been one for doing things the simple way and literally an hour after contacting my mum to tell her that she was unlikely to get the phone call to get in the car, I started having a contraction that felt just like all the others. I started to puff on the entonox and something inside went pop and all I felt was this gush. I remember hobbling to the toilet in my room shouting back to Caroline to get a midwife quick. When the midwife glanced down and saw the meconium she calmly said that I needed to get to the labour ward as one way or another this baby was going to be delivered. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, to suddenly go from being told that I was probably going to have to be induced the next morning to then having this happen was just typical of me, but I was happy that the baby had finally decided to come.  

This is when things start to go a little hazy for me. Caroline contacted my mum to tell her to make her way to the hospital. My birth plan went out the window because I originally wanted an active labour and also wanted to avoid having an epidural. I had to be monitored throughout the whole labour to make sure that the baby didn't go into distress because of the meconium. The induction drip was causing my contractions to become stronger and the pethidine and entonox were not being much help at this stage. I finally agreed to have the epidural and the anaesthetist was really good, she administered the epidural really quickly allaying all my fears of the procedure. The epidural only worked on one side of my body so I needed another dose, which caused my right side to get too much. It was quite funny when my leg kept falling off the bed and I had to ask people to pull my leg back up onto the bed. I don't recall much pain after this, I was finally able to doze off (even mid-way through conversation). I'd only had 3 hours sleep over the past few days and it was all finally starting to take its toll on me.  

Thinking back to when the midwife went to lunch, I started to feel intense aching pains in my left buttock. It felt like the worst dead leg feeling you could imagine, everyone thought it was really funny and in the end I had my epidural topped up because it was hurting continuously. I can only assume that this was me feeling the contractions as the baby moved down on his own because when I was reexamined upon the midwifes return from her break, she encountered the baby's head. I couldn't believe my ears, this labour had suddenly gone from doing nothing to everything happening. I was so pleased because I was worried it would go to a c-section, which was not what I wanted. We had a few trial pushes and then waited 40 minutes for the epidural to wear off some more.  

The pushing stage was surreal, sometimes I couldn't feel the contractions and pleaded with the midwife to tell me when to push. She was brilliant and I don't think I will ever forget her. If things ever got a little scary, she never let on and remained completely calm. It was all hands on with my mum, Caroline and the midwife all helping me to push. I wish I could have seen what was happening, but then maybe that would have stressed me out. The cord around the neck was my worst fear throughout pregnancy and when it turned into reality I became a little hysterical. I was told to stop pushing and that is easier said than done! and the cutting of the cord seemed like a life time. When Caroline started to cry I feared the worst, but hearing his tender cry after I pushed his body put turned my tears into happy tears. Watching the medical staff clearing his air ways was awful, it looked such a painful procedure. Hearing his hearty cry afterwards made me feel over the moon.  

I don't remember much after that, I was absolutely drained physically and emotionally. It was a long time before I was able to hold my son and I really wanted us to bond straight away. When I finally held him for the first time, I was besotted, it was all worth it.  

Things I will never forget... The relief I felt inside when the placenta was delivered, it felt like I had just lost a couple of stone. Being sick, I was sick several times and managed to do so on everyone including the machine that I was hooked up to! The feeling of complete happiness I felt when I held my son for the first time. The amazing people that were with me throughout my delivery and hospital care. If only I could have the same people there for number two!</value>

    <value>Watching your loved one go through the pain of labour when there is virtually nothing you can do to alleviate her pain is heart-wrenching. As the labour drags on and on sapping every ounce of her energy and Christmas Day fades into Boxing day it's hard to imagine that this little baby will ever actually be born...  
    
The first signs of labour started early on the morning of Christmas Eve. Emma's waters appeared to break so she phoned the hospital and they advised her to come in due to risk of infection. The problem with this is that she had to go through all the first stage of labour in the discomfort of a hospital ward which is not what we wanted. The labour continued for what seemed like forever, including the whole of Christmas Day.  

At around 7pm on Christmas Day Emma had a contraction that didn't feel right. "Something just went pop!", she said! Her waters had already broken but this time there was a lot more. Unfortunately it was green coloured which indicated that Evan had poo'd inside of the womb. The first poo consists of something called meconium which is green. This can be dangerous for the baby if he ingested it so Emma was taken down to the labour ward to be induced. Even though we were a little worried about this meconium it was reassuring to know that this labour was really going to get underway!  

The contractions got stronger, closer together and more painful but there was still no real progress - no dilation, despite the induction. Christmas Day passed and still nothing. Shortly after midnight the midwife examined Emma again and found her to be dilated to a fingertip :/ She went off for her break at about 1am and said she'd re-examine Emma again upon her return and if there was still no progress she'd discuss our options with the Doctor. I heard them mention the C word (caesarean) which we were rather afraid of.  

However, when examined again shortly before 3am we were all amazed to hear the words "Hello Baby!". Emma was fully dilated and the head was moving down. Great news, at last! No C-Section necessary. We waited a little while longer firstly to allow the baby to travel down further on his own to reduce the need for so much pushing and secondly to allow the effects of the epidural to wear off a little more so that Emma would be able to feel the sensations of the contractions so she'd know when to push.  

The pushing started at 3.45 and the midwife and I both stood on one side of Emma as supports for her legs to give her a bit of help! By 4.05am Evan was born but those 20 minutes were the most emotional of my life. I had so many different emotions running through my head at a time that I found it hard to cope. Watching Emma going through all that pain was unbearable and as Evan's head began to emerge I felt an incredible sense of fear that something was wrong as he was such a strange colour. (No amount of birthing TV shows and photos in magazines helped with the shock of the real thing!) The fear was made worse when the midwife shouted that his cord was around his neck! Thankfully it took them just a moment to snip off the cord and he was out in one more push but it was still incredibly frightening, exciting, and overwhelming all at the same time.  

It's an experience I will never forget and with this diary I hope that I'll never forget any of the experiences that are to come as Evan develops and grows up...</value>

    <value>My recollection of days and times became completely muddled after the birth of Evan. I was wheeled up to the postnatal ward at 7am in the morning and because we then went to bed it actually feels like I was in hospital for a day longer than I actually was. I didn't get much sleep at all and 2 hours later I woke up feeling terrible. My right leg was still completely dead and I couldn't move at all. When Evan started to cry I couldn't tend to him because of my problems with the epidural and I didn't have a nurses buzzer at the bedside either. In a panic I remember asking one of the other patients to press her buzzer for me, we had language difficulties though as she knew very little English. Instead she pressed the emergency alarm and about 10 nurses arrived at our beds less than a minute later. My nurses buzzer was fixed shortly after that incident. That first morning dragged on, I now had Evan in my arms and we just lay on the bed waiting for Caroline to arrive. I waited for as long as I could before requesting assistance from the nurses to help me and my one working leg to the toilet, I was hoping Caroline would have made it in because it would have been more dignifying having her help me. My leg felt strange as the feeling very slowly returned, I could touch my leg and feel the sensation of touch but I couldn't feel it directly underneath my fingertip. I was glad when the full sensations finally returned later on in the evening, I was beginning to wonder if it would ever return!  
    
Evan was very quiet in hospital, he hardly ever cried. Caroline looked great with him and she did all the mucky stuff while I just rested and relaxed. I think I only changed the nappies at night time when she wasn't around! The nurses were absolutely fantastic in hospital and it was really nice knowing that there was someone who knew what they were doing on the end of the buzzer. I didn't realise how much I missed them and the security of having them around until we finally went home the following evening. I remember waking up in the middle of the night following Evans birth for a feed and nappy change only to find that Evan's right eye was stuck together (known as sticky eye). I didn't know what to do, I couldn't get him to open it and I panicked. The nurses were great though, they bathed it and showed me what to do if it happened again and I was very glad that they were there.  

The hormones definitely play havoc with your system, I found that once we had left the security of the hospital environment and were now at home alone with the task of being parents, things really started to sink in and I did experience the baby blues for several days. I'd walk into a room and Caroline would see me crying and I couldn't tell her why. It's a really strange feeling, the simplest of things can just set you off. I found that the feeling of uncertainty and not knowing if I could cope without the help from the nurses would easily start the tears for me.  

I was surprised by the amount of visitors we had, almost everyday we had someone new wanting to see Evan or a delivery at the door with presents for him. It's amazing the effect babies have on people, some of the visitors had never even seen our house and that was 3 years on from when we moved in! Before the birth I speculated on how many visitors we would get because we don't have a very big circle of friends and our families aren't really that close that we see each other often, however I was quietly surprised by the amount of people that did come to welcome Evan into the world.  

We still had the visits from the community midwife to make sure that we were coping and recovering well after the birth so it was nice to know that we were only a day or two away from a health professional if we needed some advice. I was expecting Evan to lose a fair amount of weight after the birth and the midwife even told us that if he did then it was nothing to be worried about. To our surprise our little 8lb 10 baby weighed in at 8lb 8 when the midwife weighed him. Her comments following the weighing were "Well we can certainly see that you are not having problems breast feeding!" That's my boy, he certainly likes his food and he is a real guzzler too.  

We only had the one scare in the first week, I managed to give Evan a little bit of diarrhea after taking some lactulose to help me go to the toilet for the first time since the birth 3 days previous. The contents of his nappy turned green and stringy one night and I stupidly assumed that that was the Chinese seaweed that I had eaten earlier passing through to him. I can't believe I actually said that at the time and Caroline just laughed at me and posed the question "How can seaweed turn into milk and then somehow turn back into seaweed inside him?". Yes yes, it's the hormones! We actually telephoned NHS Direct that night to see if it was anything to be worried about as we had already had all the varying different coloured poo and was not expecting it to go back to green after the mustard coloured. It wasn't anything to worry about and we were just being typical new first time parents, getting worried over absolutely everything.  

Things that I'll never forget about the first week... The few nights that Evan slept really well, being able to just sit on the sofa with him lying beside me looking absolutely adorable. In that first week I felt completely contented just sitting down cuddling him while he slept peacefully in my arms. Enjoy those moments while you can because life finally has to speed up again and get back to normal.</value>

    <value>Emma and Evan were taken up to the postnatal ward at about 7am and we were all thoroughly exhausted. Her mum and I waited until they were both settled and then went home for some well-earned sleep! The drive home was weird. It was about -3 outside and the car was frozen solid. To me it was the end of a very long night but in reality the day was just starting. As I started to drive the emotion of it all really hit me and I had tears streaming down my face all the way home. I slumped into bed and managed to get about 3 hours sleep...  
    
Going back into hospital that afternoon was equally weird as it felt like the next day. I was so tired that I almost crashed on one of the roundabouts on the way in! I remember thinking to myself that the next time I would see Evan he'd be about twice the age he was when I last saw him! Of course, that's only a few hours but I was worried that he'd have changed completely and I wouldn't recognise him.  

The midwife had phoned me at home just before I left the house saying that Emma had been asking for me so I envisaged walking in to a bedraggled girlfriend and a screaming baby! I was pleasantly surprised to see Emma sitting up in bed with Evan fast asleep and sprawled out before her on the bed. I just had to take a photo and it's one of my favourites of the early ones.  

Shortly after getting to the hospital I was faced with my first dirty nappy. You know, I had actually completely forgotten that babies needed nappy changing (doh!) It was pretty mucky (and I took a photo of it too!) but I didn't mind at all, it was actually kinda cute! I felt a bit intimidated though having to change my first nappy in front of the midwife and I also felt very awkward handling him.  

The next few hours I remember spending ages just looking at Evan, trying to "learn" his face. By the following day I had also started to learn his voice and if I was out in the corridor I was able to distinguish his cries from that of the other babies.  

I was really worried about coming home with Evan because we have three cats and we were quite apprehensive about their behaviour towards him. We anticipated that Treacle would be so scared of this noisy thing that she'd spend 6 months hiding under the bed, Poppy would probably hiss at him lots and Cleo, once she figured that he wasn't edible, would just lose interest. We were right about Cleo but Poppy is quite the opposite. She loves to be around him and when he cries she perks up, walks right over to him and gives him a good sniff. She also guards the door when he's in the bedroom on his own and meows to go in there, little cutie. Treacle is being remarkably brave (she's an incredibly scatty cat!) and she's quite a sight to watch as she tip-paws up to him, has a tentative sniff and then jumps out of her fur and bolts at the slightest sniffle! Anyway there's no hissing so we're pleased.  

All the visitors we had in the first week were rather disconcerting. They were mostly Emma's relatives and seeing as Evan isn't biologically related to me I can't help but feeling like a bit of an outsider. I'm hoping that feeling will pass with time. For now I've just been playing host, making everybody cups of tea and letting them pass him around like a new toy.  

Our first trip outside of the house was a bit of an adventure! We figured we'd go to Mothercare as that's a nice "safe" environment to take a baby and if he cried it wouldn't be as embarrassing as it would be in the local supermarket. Well, that was the theory anyway. After struggling with the pushchair for ages we finally made it into the shop. Emma had to go off and get measured for a nursing bra so I was left with Evan hanging out in the underwear section! My worst fears were realised when he started to cry, then howl, and finally scream! I picked him up rather awkwardly and tried my best to hide behind the huge disposable knickers! It seemed like an age before Emma came back and I just handed him straight back to her - "your baby!". Naughty I know :-)</value>

    <value>After the crazy hectic first week at home, most people we knew had managed to see Evan and the daily visits had died down. I had been warned in pregnancy to expect my washing machine to be busy and I am starting to see that now. On average we are doing 2 loads a day when before having Evan I'd only have the washing machine on 3 times a week! I just hope my washing machine survives the extra workload as even before Evan I noticed it was starting to groan lots.  

The long hard nights started this week and Evan was becoming as regular as clockwork with his "rattyness" starting around 7pm. We'd struggle to settle him for most of the evening, bed time being the hardest. It doesn't help that he really dislikes lying on his back, his favourite position being upright against my chest with his head nuzzled under my chin.   

This year was the very first time that we spent Christmas at home together in 7 years. Usually we are at either mine or Caroline's mums house but seeing as I was heavily pregnant, we decided to stay at home. We were hoping Evan would arrive early and then we could have a Christmas dinner with him so we stocked up on everything, turkey, vegetables and we even planned to make a nice Christmas dessert. All of this ended up in the bin when we returned home from hospital but we weren't to be deterred. We bought a new turkey and Caroline cooked us our Christmas dinner this week. It was lovely and I'll never forget how funny it looked when Caroline was trying to rinse out this huge turkey in the sink, holding its legs in the air. I found it incredibly hilarious that I filmed it on the camcorder, unfortunately I didn't take any static photos of this particular event.  

We had an early appointment this week to get Evan registered and of all the nights where we really needed our sleep was the night before this day. We could not get Evan settled at all, he cried so much it made me cry too. We tried rocking, singing and cuddling but none of this would settle him at all. We were really concerned that something was seriously wrong with him and this night we called the labour ward for advice. I had to take the call in another room and the midwife could still hear him crying. She put it down to a bit of colic and said that we needed to stay strong, give him a bath and to maybe put him on the boob every time he became distressed to calm him. The feeding turned out to help hugely, though it was really rough for me and my boobs. We took it in turns to pace the room cuddling him as well as the feeding trick. We managed to get around 3 hours sleep that night and amazingly we were able to get up, washed and dressed in time to leave the house at 9am. I think Evan and I slept in the car, but poor Caroline had to do the driving.

As soon as we returned with his birth certificates we took turns looking after Evan whilst the other got a good earned rest in bed. I found it very hard to sleep without Evan nearby, so my sleep was very broken with me continually waking because I missed him.

    <value>I'm not exactly sure if week two was better or worse than the first week. It was nice that the visiting died down a bit and we were able to get used to a new life of three, but it was also hard dealing with Evans ever-increasing crying.  

It doesn't matter how many books you read, or what advice people give you, every baby is different. I kept reading how babies need to be calmed when they are crying by gentle rocking and speaking softly buy none of that worked with Evan. Quite the opposite in fact. I found that he seemed to like quite vigorous movement and the more he cried the more I'd have to bounce him around to stop him crying! One of the things we bought to help Emma with the labour was one of those exercise balls. Pacing around the room trying to bounce Evan around vigorously was very tiring so I tried just sitting on the ball and bouncing while holding him. To my amazement, it worked so that became my new baby-settling routine!  

Before we knew the sex of the baby I wanted a girl because I didn't really want to have to deal with "boys bits" :-) Now that he's here I wouldn't change him for the world of course but his little bits certainly do have a life of their own at changing time! I'm not sure how many times he's peed on me, or himself, or the carpet but I had the delights of being poo'd on this weekend! My best friend had come to stay and we were happily chatting away while I was changing Evan and suddenly his bottom just erupted and he squirted bright yellow poo all over my hand! Lovely :-)
