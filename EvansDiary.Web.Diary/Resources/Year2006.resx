    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>This month saw the change over to Evan nearly always walking and not so much of the crawling anymore. By the end of his first week back at nursery there was no stopping him.   

As a result of his increased walking, especially as he is still unsteady some of the time, we are seeing more bumps and bruises than ever before. He is ever so confident and will quite happily eat bits of food off of your plate and then walk around the room chomping away. He'll even twist and turn a lot especially when holding a toy of some sort. He can dance up and down on his feet as well and he is definitely aware of music and dancing. His little baby bop is absolutely adorable. He is more aware of children's TV these days, he still recognises and likes the theme tunes to the TV programs that we watch but he stops and wanders over to the TV when channels like CBeebies are on, one of his favourites at the moment is 'Boogie Beebies'.  

We had our worst accident to date this month and it was one that happened when he lost his balance and slipped on the slippery bathroom floor. I was running a bath for Evan and hadn't taken his clothes off so he was wandering around still with his socks on. We have a small tiled ledge that runs the width of the bathroom and he was leaning against it while waving a toy around, when he slipped and fell. We couldn't cushion the fall as he fell away from us but when Caroline picked him up she passed him over to me saying *"He needs mummy's special cuddles"*. I couldn't believe it when I glanced down at him to assess the damage as blood was pouring from his mouth. I had to hold my hand to catch it all. It took a while to stem the flow and the cause of such bleeding was what I now know to be a fairly common mouth injury in small children. He had separated the bit of loose skin that joins your upper lip to your gum. It took several days to reattach itself properly and cleaning his teeth was a real nightmare to make sure we didn't catch it and make it bleed again...  

Evan has a new game and it is one that both Caroline and I really like. He likes to put all his toys away into his toy boxes, actually he just puts everything he can find into his toy boxes, but at least it's a start! It is really cute when I tip all his Lego out onto the floor and all he wants to do is put them back away. He does get bored after a while, so we only usually get half of the tidying up done before he gets distracted.  

I had to take Evan for his MMR this month, something I was dreading as I had to go alone with him. For all his other injections I was able to take someone along with me for support. He didn't actually cry until the nurse started injecting the fluid in and that's what used to make me scream when Caroline had to inject the fertility drugs into me. The initial prick is nothing to worry about, it's the nasty evil fluid that stings! Evan buried his head into my chest and let out this real hearty traumatic cry, luckily enough it only took me a minute or so to calm him down. I accepted the plaster, but I now wish I'd not bothered because it didn't really bleed after we had removed the cotton ball and the plaster was a pain to remove later on that evening when Evan was in the bath. I don't think he has anymore injections now until pre-school age so we're both happy about that!  

Evan had a new experience this month learning what things he must remember not to do. We were giving him a new hair cut, these can take quite a time and are rather messy in the process. I was sitting in front of him keeping him amused whilst Caroline did the snipping. The occasional clump of hair dropped down in front of him and before I could stop him on this one instance, he picked it up and instinctively ate it! Big mistake.... he then pulled this funny face in disgust and pushed his tongue out with all the hair on it. I then spent the next few minutes trying to get it all out of his mouth, poor baby...</value>

  <data name="y2Feb" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It doesn't feel like only a year ago I was a new mum doing the whole mother and baby thing going to my weekly weigh-in clinics to make sure that Evan was getting enough breast milk and developing as he should. Time really has flown by; sometimes I really miss it. This month has been a stressful month and it has taken its toll on all of us. Some days I just wish it wasn't such a rush and that Evan and I could once again just spend some quality time together. It doesn't seem right that Saturday and Sunday are the only days that we truly have to ourselves, I miss him dearly at work. I think the long hours and lack of sleep because Evan has had a niggling cough and cold that refused to abate attributed to my illnesses. It all seemed to happen at once and fortunately Caroline escaped it all so she was able to look after us. Evan and I had been battling between us to rid ourselves of the common cold bug that was going round with little success. I thought I was finally getting better when I fell ill with a gastric virus. It was awful, I had kept Evan home from nursery as well because he had had a fever and vomiting episode the previous day. I was so ill that day that I had to call Caroline home from University and I slept for the best part of 24 hours. Even when I have been ill before, I have been able to get up to Evan when he needed me but it was unfamiliar territory with this illness, I could here Evan stirring in his cot from his nap and I just couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. I was stuck and I was so glad that it would only take Caroline 20 minutes to get home. It was probably good that I kept my distance because I certainly didn't want Evan to get my stomach virus.  

I took some more pictures of Evan into work this month as they get displayed by my screen saver when my PC is idle. I wish I had time and most importantly good day light to take more photos of Evan. I have roughly 600 pictures that were taken during the first 9 months of his life. In the past 3 months coinciding with my return to work, I have only managed to take just over 100 pictures! He's changed so much that it really does show when you compare the pictures.  

Evan finally has a new tooth!! For months we have had only 6 *(4 at the top and 2 at the bottom)*, but now we have a third at the bottom. I was expecting a few more to be honest as his teething has been playing havoc with his bottom and he's also been getting really hot and flushed around his cheeks.  

Evan has changed how he plays whilst in the bath and shower. When he showers with us he now likes to try and drink the water as it sprays down. In the bath he likes to place all his cups and ducks along the edge of the bath, lining them neatly into a row before knocking off. He also likes to launch his toys out of the bath and he finds it increasingly funny when the toys still contain water and they land on one of his mummies!  

Evan has started to lean up against things and he also likes to sit on chair like items like the stool or bathroom ledge. He still has a lot to learn though as he doesn't understand much about heights. He managed to launch himself off of the stool this month onto his head sending the whole of his body toppling over. I saw it all happening in slow motion but could quite stop it from happening, I caught him in mid air but I wasn't quick enough to stop the initial impact. He is showing a desire to walk forwards down the stairs, but again I don't think he is quite ready for that. He has managed once or twice to go down the stairs backwards, bum first.  

I took Evan to an indoor soft play area this month called *"Snakes and Ladders"*. I'd taken him to a smaller one a few months back and he was quite nervous and clingy but I thought that was probably because he couldn't walk when all the other children could. He was terrified and he absolutely hated it. I couldn't get him to set a foot onto the soft play mats at all, it was as if he hated the feel of it on his skin. He would sit on the carpet area and play with the ball pen balls or push the ride on cars around but as soon as I took him anywhere near the soft play structures he would stiffen his limbs and cling on to me for dear life crying his poor little eyes out. It was awful to see him so traumatised and I felt like this bad mummy. I thought he would love it, I just hope I haven't traumatised him for life. I couldn't even get him to like the ball pen area and I know he likes these because he played in the ball pen that Megan had at her house. The bouncy castle was a failure as well, Evan hasn't really liked engine noises like the sound of a vacuum cleaner and that is what the bouncy castle sounded like. I placed Evan through the gap onto the bouncy castle and he freaked out launching himself into my arms and crying this really traumatised stuttered cry. We stayed for roughly an hour playing on the carpet and it felt really awkward because Evan was the only child who didn't like it and the looks I was getting from some of the other parents made me just want to hide under a rock. I'll leave it a few months before trying that again.</value>

  <data name="y2Mar" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We've converted Evan's walker into his car now and he loves to ride on it. He loves it when I push him really fast steering him around the room. He can however drive himself somewhat more slowly using his feet correctly. He still has to master the steering though and he has no problems getting on and off it either. He has also mastered turning his walker full of bricks instead of crying when it hits the wall. He now anticipates the distance to the wall and turns it accordingly, most of the time he does it perfectly.  

Evan started a new nursery this month, one that is much closer to my workplace and means I have no more worrying trips to the nursery wondering what the traffic is going to be like. I had a very close call this month, it was in Evan's last week at his old nursery and the main motorway home was at a standstill. Luckily I left work on time and made it with less than a minute to spare! It was sad to see him leave the nursery where he was settled and I did have my worries when we did the introduction days and throughout the first week because Evan was getting very upset. It didn't help that once again starting a brand new environment brought with it a load of new illnesses for Evan to get! After 2 whole weeks at the new nursery, we stopped getting tears and he seems to have settled really well. He's gone from being the most advanced and one of the oldest in his nursery room to being the youngest at his new nursery. He surrounded by a lot of 18 month to 2 year olds and they tower over him. They are speaking and always point at me and say *"Evan's mummy"* when I drop him off and collect him.  

Evan's speech is slowly developing at last and he is now showing signs of saying something like *"nana"*. I don't think he knows what it means though, it's just the next stage in his speech development, though I am sure the grandmothers will love it! He can say 'cat' and 'duck' pretty well now and his understanding is very good even though he's not actually saying words. I asked him to pick up the yellow block and he just kept pointing to any block on the floor but when I then asked him to pick up the yellow block by the ball, he pointed to it. After repeatedly asking and him pointing at the correct block *(he had the choice of 3)* he then picked up the block and stacked it on top of the 2 that were already stacked.  

Bath time fun is on the change again. He can now fill his boat with water, bring it to his mouth and then drink it! yuk... :).He can also tip cups of water out and he seems to think it is very funny to tip it over my head when I am washing his body or just launching them at me getting the bathroom completely soaked.  

Evan is such a cutie, these days when I am getting him dressed, the first thing he picks up is his comb. I've not really used his comb but somehow he knew exactly what to do with it. He held it up to the side of his head and did the combing action. He can even comb my hair when I ask him!—how cute is that?  

Evan has an obsession with boxes and baskets at the moment. He will carry them from one room to the other and then he will start putting items into the boxes ranging from his toys to our shoes! As soon as he has placed a few items in the container he will then take them out and take them to the next container he has found. He loves helping out and these little domestic traits are lovely to witness. One thing that Evan really enjoys is taking the recyclable rubbish to the recycling box outside. I will carry him and he will hold the recycling. When we arrive at the box he peers down and sometimes it takes a little while to coax him into dropping the item but he does do it eventually. I then say *"well done Evan, give mummy a high five!"*, holding my hand out in the air and Evan obliges with a couple of pats with his hand.  

I was changing Evan one day this month and he managed to pull a wipe out of the box while I was tending to his nether region. He made me laugh so much when he then started rubbing the wipe down by his groin—he was trying to help me wipe himself clean. He's a very domesticated little boy; he's witnessed several spillages with me cleaning them up. It's funny to watch him when he picks up a cloth, tea towel or tissue, he starts wiping any surface from tables to floors, it's adorable to watch.  

We have new teeth and one of them is his first molar. That was a big beast when it started to rupture and we had some very hard nights because Evan was waking a lot for cuddles. It's horrible seeing him in such discomfort but I am glad that my cuddles, a bottle or a small dose of Calpol do the trick.</value>

    <value>As the weather has now started to improve and Evan is "Mr Confident" on his feet we've started to take Evan outdoors much more this month. We decided our first outdoor trip would be a fairly close one and it would last only the morning. I'd already highlighted a few places that I wanted to visit this year with Evan so we chose [Odds Farm Park](http://www.oddsfarm.co.uk/). It's baby season in the animal kingdom and at Odds Farm they had lots of baby lambs, piglets and goats, some literally hours old for Evan to look at. He liked looking at all the animals *(but at a distance)*. He didn't go too close to the rams as they were being extremely rough with people feeding them and I would have been nervous had he wanted to go over to them. The bunny rabbits were really cute and they had lots of different breeds for us to see. Watching Evan checking out some of the larger animals *(pigs in particular)*, he would bend down a little, pull this little *"oh"* look and say *"ooh"* pointing at the animal. He managed to walk most of the way round the park himself, strapped into his new walking harness. Odds farm had lots of other things for children to do from all ages, so it was an enjoyable day out. It was probably more expensive than I would have liked, threfore it's not a trip we would do often as there is really only so many sheep and goats that you want to look at.  

Caroline has been teaching Evan some new tricks! We have a weight training bench in one of our rooms and Evan is always running in there when we turn our backs. We have not baby proofed this room and as a result he becomes attracted to various things in there—the weights being one of them. He likes to lift the half pound discs off the ground and hands them to us. We also have a dumbbell bar with no weights on it and Evan likes to lift it as if he were doing exercises. It is rather amusing and I was quite surprised to see that he could indeed lift such a thing. The working out doesn't end there, we've got Evan's swing securely into the ground now and we were just messing around out there one day, when we attempted to do some pull-ups using the top of the swing bar. Evan thought this was rather a good idea and he ran over to the swing where the bars go across at my waist height. He can just about reach them and he tried to copy our pull-ups using those bars. Clever boy!  

Evan absolutely loves the garden, every day when he is at home we go outside and play whenever it's not raining. Evan actually lets me know when he wants to go outside, he'll stand by the patio door and start pointing out to the garden whilst jabbering away to me. If I don't initiate the getting ready, he then wanders off and finds his shoes, brings them to me and shoves them into my lap. If I don't get the hint then, he gets a little upset! He's such a good little boy when he knows we're going outside, he'll sit down when I ask him so that I can put on his shoes. He'll also get his coat *(if it's not hung up)* and when we are all ready he stands by the door eagerly running on the spot because he can't get out. The long Easter weekend that we had this month was great for garden play and the weather was really nice for it. We could do with some more outdoor type toys though! We taught Evan how to kick a football, you never know, he might actually like to play it one day ;). He does like to copy us a lot at the moment, one example was watching him and Caroline playing on the grass. She got tired and flopped down onto her back. Evan started to giggle, he the ran over to her and did exactly the same! It was very funny, I couldn't get the camera out in time to get a picture, it would have been a great one.  

We took half a day off this month so that I could meet up with the girls and babies that I spent a lot of time with whilst on maternity leave. We hadn't seen each other since the New Year, so it was great to catch up. It was nice to see how different each child was and interesting to see that only Megan was really into her talking. I will miss Evan's baby babble *(because it's just the cutest thing!)* but I can't wait to actually be able to communicate properly with him. We manage, but at times I just know he is getting frustrated because I haven't understood what he was trying to get me to do. Evan is still the shortest so it was interesting to see what sort of things I have to look forward to. Alex can now open doors! That's going to be a nightmare when Evan can do that because I use the doors to stop him from going into rooms that I don't want him in. Our door handles seem to be located a little higher than most so hopefully we'll be able to reason with him by the time he can start to open them *(fingers crossed).* They did play nicely together and Rachel took some great pictures of them all playing.  

Evan has had an obsession with the Sky viewing card this month and it's driving us crazy. We lost it this month and I heard Caroline telling him off when she realised where he had put it, he'd managed to shove it in the video player!  

We managed to get a weekend when we were all free of germs and illnesses this month so we decided to get down the swimming pool. Unfortunately it has been 5 months since we last went swimming and as a result Evan had forgotten the experience and most of all he'd lost the baby reflexes that he had in the water. He spent the first 15 minutes crying and it was really traumatising for us. He did eventually settle but spent most of the time clinging onto our necks as we carried him through the water. He didn't try to swim like he did all those months ago with the kicking and the flapping. I thought he might object a little bit, but I was not prepared for this. We left the pool in a happier state but I still don't think Evan liked it that much. We're planning to pay regular visits to try and get him used to it again so *fingers crossed*.  

Evan's block stacking is coming on leaps and bounds, he can stack loads. We managed to capture on film Evan stacking 8 blocks. It was interesting to watch because he knows that he can get away with stacking the blocks hard and rough when there are only a couple but as the tower grows, he starts to place them gently instead of roughly as he now knows that the tower will collapse under too much force.  

There is one incident that happened this month that I'm sure Caroline would like to forget about. She was doing his evening bath one day and I could hear them playing happily when I suddenly heard her calling my name. I was outside at the time, so I raced back in and up the stairs and to my surprise I found Evan standing in the bath surrounded by his poo. Apparently, he just decided to squat down and do his poo right there! :) I wondered if this would ever happen to us as I have heard so many poo in the bath incidents from friends with children. We didn't really know what to do, so we just used the shower to clean him up, his bath time being cut short that day. He hated the shower going on him that close, it didn't help that it wasn't the warmest as we'd run out of hot water. He jumped up out of the bath as I held him whilst Caroline had the shower and the poor little boy was just suspended there whilst we cleaned him up *(such strength he has!).* Let's hope that this is the first and last time that we experience poo in the bath!  

Finally, we've kind of sussed *"cat"* and *"car"* out on the speech front, *"duck"* is still more of a *"dat"* but we made real progress this month with a new word. Evan said *"mummy"* properly and it wasn't a *"mum mum mama"* that he sometimes says when crying. He was just standing next to me and he said *"mama"*. To test the theory, later on I was standing by the sink doing some washing up and Caroline asked Evan *"Who is mummy?"* and he pointed to me :).</value>

  <data name="y2May" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan recently started showing signs of noticing things outside in particular he points to birds and makes *"oohh"* noises when they fly around and hop along the floor. This month Evan had a new interest outside—planes. He absolutely adores them and seeing as we live just off the flight path to Heathrow Airport we do get our fair share or aeroplanes flying above the house and some are usually a lot closer if they are coming in to land, as Heathrow is roughly 20 minutes away from where we live. He loves the planes though and he can hear them even when he is indoors and he'll instinctively point up into the air. When I take him outside to look for the aeroplanes he is mesmerised by them and he can spot the ones flying really high as well. He can even spot them before we actually see them, so that's a good sign that he has good hearing!  

We had a funny little moment this month. I arrived to collect Evan from nursery one Friday afternoon and I was getting lots of smiles from the staff as I passed them by. Evan was out in the garden playing in the Wendy house when I arrived, so I made my way outside to see him. I was stopped by one of the nursery staff who works in his room and she chuckled as she chatted to me, mentioning that they had a little accident today with the red paint. I laughed and groaned trying to remember what clothes he was dressed in this morning, wondering if I'd get the paint out in the wash. It took a few minutes for Evan to spot me and when he started to run over to me smiling away, I suddenly noticed something rather odd about his head. When he finally arrived at my feet I noticed the pink colouring in his fluffy blonde hair. They had had this free painting session in the afternoon and Evan chose the red paint. Instead of painting the paper, he blobbed a big glob of it in his head. They tried ever so hard to get the paint from his hair but for some reason it just wouldn't budge and instead it turned pink! Evan does have a thing for pink. It even stained his scalp! The clothes didn't escape punishment and he did go through my spare tops as well because he was wearing a t-shirt that was owned by the nursery.  

Evan has started to show an interest in our neighbours dogs. At first he just called them cats, which was highly amusing but we've managed to get him to understand over the month of May that a dog is actually *"dog"*. He's sussed it out quite well, Our next door neighbour has an energetic dog that reminds me of a sheep dog and we have a low bit of fencing at the back of our garden that allows her to see into our garden to watch Evan. Evan knows exactly where the dog should be when she watches him play because he'll point over to the low bit of fencing whether she is there or not and still say *"Dug" (which is how dog sounds when he says it).* He is more nervous with this dog than the neighbour across the road that has an even bigger dog *(like the Dulux paint dog, but his hair has been shaved).* We did have one incident with Billy *(the Dulux dog)* when he bumped past Evan and it startled him and made him cry but most of the time he just tries to follow them to stroke their backs.  

Evan's mummies were very naughty this month and we *(well I decided)* to have a go on Evan's swing with the non-baby seat attachment. My bum could just about squeeze in it and I placed Evan on my lap and we swayed forward and back. The trouble happened when we convinced Caroline to come and join us! She pushed us quite high to the amusement of Evan on my lap, but I just didn't feel safe and it terrified me! Suddenly the legs started to come out of the ground—that's no small feat either as these legs are supported by poles that are 12 inches long and hammered into the ground.  

We took Evan into Reading with us this month for a shopping trip. I took a packed lunch as I knew we wouldn't be back home in time for his lunch. We actually went to our first meal venue with him, we chose to have our lunch at Pizza Hut. Evan appeared to enjoy the atmosphere around us and he ate most of his lunch plus helped us out with garlic bread and pizza. He really does love his garlic bread. I do find that when there is a lot going on around us at Evan's meal times, he gets a little lazy. This usually results in him not chewing enough and then having a little choke on the food. This happened twice at Pizza Hut, but luckily we all survived. His feeding has developed a significant amount this month in that he doesn't want any assistance at all. He will sometimes refuse to even have us sitting directly next to him and we just have to let him get on with it. That's ok when it's something chunky that he can pick up, but when we have cereals and soups, it's not so much fun because he can't get it all on the spoon or it just falls off as he tries to get it in his mouth. He is getting quite good at it though and the nursery rarely have to intervene to help him and that's probably why we are having difficulty because we've been trying to do the feeding, when all he wants, is to do it himself. We are still having difficulty in the evening feeding him his last meal but this is usually because of a mixture of things, he's tired and only a little bit hungry and he also knows he's due a bottle. The problem we are finding is that if he doesn't eat and refuses his food, he'll wake up a couple of hours into his sleep because he is hungry.</value>

    <value>We've seen a lot of changes this month most notably with Evan's feeding routine. I couldn't understand why Evan was eating so well at nursery but when he's at home he just refuses. It suddenly occurred to me that it could be the way that we were initiating the feeding. At nursery Evan sits around a table with up to 7 other children and the nursery ladies just sit at a corner to help when necessary. They are all sitting in little versions of grown up chairs and they are left to feed themselves and they do just that. Evan is very competent with a spoon in both hands and he also loves to muck in with just his hands! I decided to try this technique at home and it worked, Evan is objecting at home because he wants to feed himself and he prefers it if you are not sitting right next to him *(as I have a tendency to interfere).* Feeding times are so messy now that we've had to move his high chair into our already cramped kitchen.  

We've been on a lot of mini adventures this month and the weather had been fabulous for it as well. We went to see Caroline's mum who lives near Southend. Whilst we were there, *(it was such a hot weekend that we needed to get out of her home as it felt like a green house)* that we ventured off to Southend beach. The stoney beach didn't go down too well with Evan's new jelly shoes but we can't all live near Bournemouth now, can we? Evan just wanted to spend the whole time picking up the stones! He absolutely hated the water though! It was a tad chilly and he just kept crying whenever we ventured closer. We didn't spend too much time on the beach to Caroline's disappointment, we didn't want Evan to build up a fear of the sea. There's a Sea life Centre at one end of the sea front and we've been wanting to take Evan to one for ages so we decided to do it. At first it seemed like a big mistake because Evan didn't like the dark corridors but once we got up close and personal to the fish he seemed to settle down. It was quite interesting, though it would have been nicer if there were more fish to see... It was a great weekend, apart from the silly parking ticket I received... *grumble, grumble...*  

We went on a nursery trip this month to Wellplace Zoo. It was Evan's first experience on a coach and it was more cramped than I remember them! That could be because I was about 4ft the last time I went and probably much thinner :). The car seat did take up 1 and a half seats and Caroline took up the other seat so I crammed into the middle seat on the row of three, so that didn't help the situation either. I thought it would be a proper Zoo with Elephants and Giraffes but it was actually much smaller with a mixture of Zoo animals like Monkeys, Cats and Penguins and Farm animals like Peacocks, Chickens, Donkeys etc... Evan still seemed to enjoy himself though as he loves animals!  

We have cracked swimming again! We tried a new technique with Evan, this time we let him walk up to the pool holding Caroline's hand. Our local swimming pool that we visit has a nice slope that lets you just walk straight in without having to step down. I then get in the pool and sit on the floor enticing Evan into the pool. He usually spends a minute or so just stamping his feet in the really shallow bit because it splashes lots but he does eventually wander in, getting the water fairly high up his chest, usually accompanied by a gasp because the temperature is a bit of a shock. He seems to be enjoying himself just like when he was a baby and we're also seeing him kick his legs a little bit as well. We've got a set of armbands as well that assist us when take him for a little swim, he's not so top heavy anymore! It really is lovely to see him enjoy himself in the water again.  

We've had even more water successes this month. After the teaser at Southend beach, we decided to embark on a day trip to Bournemouth where the beach is lovely sand! It was a long day and we weren't sure what to expect as the last time we went to Bournemouth with Evan he could only sit up so he was very static. This time however, he was in to everything and it was non stop! It was really tiring but he absolutely loved it *(except when he tipped handfuls of sand in his face!).* He didn't like the water at first when we tried to walk in with him. Caroline was having a well earned rest when Evan and I explored nearer the sea. This time I let Evan walk up to it *(like he did with the swimming pool)* and he stopped about 1ft away from the water. I stepped in and starting splashing around with my feet and playing chase games with the ripples as the waves met the sandy shore. Evan was more at ease by this time and he seemed to forget why he was scared and joined in the fun. Caroline must have spotted us because she joined in and Evan was getting absolutely soaked. When he tried to go in further, that's when we tried again and this time Caroline successfully managed to wade in with him. He thoroughly enjoyed his time at the beach playing with the sand, our beach ball and the sea. I'm not sure if we'll make it again this summer, but hopefully next year will be even better if we could only explain to Evan that taking peoples shoes and sand toys is not appropriate behaviour.  

Evan's favourite play time toys are his books at the moment, especially this little Thomas the Tank Engine pop out book. It has these little cardboard train shapes that you can remove from the pages. The idea is to then find the right page for the puzzle piece that matches. They can be fairly stiff, so it's quite common for us to spend 20 minutes or so going over this book having him point at the piece because he can't remove it and then say *"uuuuhhhhh"* to me frantically pointing at the shape because he needs my help. He has his favourite books already, there's one with vehicles that he really loves and we play this game where I ask *"Show me the Fire Engine"* and Evan will find the page with the fire engine and point to it. He knows every single vehicle in that book and the game hasn't grown old yet—cutie...  

Evan surprised us this month with a new word out of the blue! We were standing in the bathroom, I can't remember what we were all doing but we were going out of the room. He just turned to Caroline, waved to her and said *"bye-bye".* I was gob smacked because he'd never even tried to say it before, he's only ever waved. It was a real emotional event. With all the other words he has spoken, they've been along time coming because he half gets it and then one day he finally says it correctly or to the best of his ability. *"Bye-bye"* was totally different, he just said it that once and got it right first time and it was brilliant to see it first hand. He now says it whenever we leave the house or even if we just leave the company of someone, he also says it when we put him down to bed. It's just great to see him with this new word and he uses it in the correct context already!</value>

  <data name="y2Jul" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan spent his first night away from home this month. It was Caroline's graduation ceremony and we had a very early start so to save my mum having to get up at 5am to come over to baby sit Evan, we decided it would be better for all parties if he stayed the night at hers. It was a real success and something we hope to do again because it was great for Grandma to spend time with Evan and he just loved the mini adventure! I missed him, as expected but that was only because I've never spent any overnight time away from him. I did wander around his bedroom just before I went to bed; which felt very weird. It's very similar to when Caroline has been off with Evan and I'm so used to driving to work with him that suddenly you look in the rear of the car and he's not there sitting in his chair! The only tears we had was when Evan arrived home and I think it was just his way of coping with seeing me again, he became really clingy and cried when I went out of the room.  

Evan seems to love nursery so much at the moment, that home time is rather time consuming these days. He used to love coming home with me and he'd babble about his day all the way home. These days I have to chase him around the nursery and he fights me all the way to the car. I'm really glad he loves nursery and doesn't miss me anymore but I wish he'd give me an easy time when it comes to loading him in the car. This has become Caroline's job now because I don't have the strength to keep him in his seat and usually come out of the car 10 minutes later, sweating and covered in marks where he has kicked me.  

I think we are experiencing some of the character traits displayed by the *"terrible twos"*. Evan has this little routine when he wants to throw a tantrum and these tantrums can be for the silliest reasons, though I am sure to him they are very huge. His tantrums of late consist of stamping feet and then he'll launch himself on the floor face down, kicking legs, banging his arms and screeching. Other types of tantrums when he's not getting what he wants is usually to dive at my feet grabbing my legs to stop me from moving—rather disturbing at times as I don't see it coming...  

The whole feeding routine has completely changed this month. We've gone from having issues with feeding that caused Evan to wake up a few hours after going to bed so hungry that his stomach was growling. We later identified that the real reason for this was that he didn't want any help what so ever, unless instigated by him. Further on into the month, this went a step further in that Evan no longer wants to sit strapped into his high chair. At nursery, they all sit around a small table with chairs. I can see why he has started to object to the high chair because he just wants his routine to continue. I decided to try out my theory and for 2 weeks we had Evan sitting on a pillow on one of our dining room chairs and he got on really well with this. Of course, this could not continue because it really wasn't safe, so now we've bought this little handy travel booster chair from Mothercare that straps to your current dining room chair. He really likes it and it's the next best thing to what he does at nursery. He gets to sit at the table with us and is no longer strapped in using a harness, the straps on this booster are less restrictive. He did push the chair away from the table sending the chair flying once—that was scary! Luckily he hasn't done it since.  

Evan's vocabulary is coming on leaps and bounds this month, he keeps surprising us with new words, we've had *Cake, Box, Baby, Teddy* to name but a few.. His play style has changed a lot as well, he is really starting to show an interest in his books and puzzles, especially the ones that allow him to interact with them *(books with removable shapes)*. I now have to read to Evan when we go to bed, there is no chance of us avoiding this part of his routine, it is nice though because it's lovely quality time that we get to spend together. We do have 3 books that he wants to read over and over again though and he likes them to be read in a specific order!  

It was the month of birthdays as my brothers and I were all born in July! We had a BBQ for my eldest brother and Evan had so much fun terrorising them. They haven't seen him walking so were very worried every time he stumbled. Caroline and I just let him get on with it and it was a nice break for us as he had lots of people interacting with him. He absolutely loves dogs and my brother's dog Izzy was so happy to have a play mate for the day. They played tug-of-war with her toys and she even collected the balls that Evan threw for her. The only issue was that the dog ran out of energy before Evan did and he just wouldn't let her rest! It was a lovely day and we had so much fun. Neil's friends came over with their children and the dad was playing rough games with his kids on the floor. Evan just ran over and joined in all the fun jumping on top of him, he loved the rough play—Dads are great for that! I'm ok with a certain amount of rough play, but jumping on my chest would have certainly been a no no...  

Evan has learnt a new word that he uses incessantly—*"more"*. He sometimes uses it in the correct context but he'll also just use it whenever he wants something. For example, he'll stand at the fridge pointing to it and saying *"more"* when he would like his drink. If you give him something to eat like some strawberries that he ate at my mum's. He'll just keep saying more, more, more when he wants another. It can get quite irritating. He also has this new arm action that he uses very well. When something is all gone *(like food)*, or if someone has gone out of the room, he'll do this *"all-gone"* arm movement where he puts his arms out to the side. It's rather cute, but it's another action that he uses a lot.  

I finally got around to collecting and building Evan's slide this month. It was a present at Christmas time from Evan's grandma. It took me a couple of days and some help from my neighbour to build the beast, but it was definitely worth it. Evan really likes it, he even likes to roll his balls down it!  

It was my birthday right at the end of July and as a treat to the family we decided to spend the day at Legoland. Evan seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself and every time we saw something new he said *"Oh"* or *"Wow"* pointing and jumping around excitedly. It was a tiring day but we all seemed to cope. Conveniently, we had just finished the last ride in the park that Evan could go on, when he pointed to his push chair. We sat him in it and he promptly fell asleep... *"Ah bless.."* He'd been running around with his harness on all day and I was very surprised to see him last that long. It was a fabulous day! We're going to take him again in September as we have some free tickets.  

What a month! It's been great!</value>

    <value>All those nice things I was saying about Evan and nursery last month completely changed this month. We lost a few of the nursery staff in Evan's room in July, some that I was rather fond of and Evan absolutely adored. He seems to have his favourites! This month I received a shock when our favourite member of staff, the lady in charge of Evan's room decided that she too wanted to leave and it was all rather sudden. There has been a lot of changes implemented in the nursery since the change in management and this has caused tension amongst the staff. I don't know the full details and I probably never will but I'm not happy at all with how it was handled and it caused a lot of unsettled children in Evan's room in particular. Evan was still happy after the first few left, but when Heather suddenly left, things took a turn for the worse. Evan no longer wanted to go to nursery and I had to leave him there crying and upset every morning, where as previously he'd always go to Heather with a great big hug. He started to be really pleased to see me at home time and couldn't wait to get into the car. It's taken a few weeks for him to settle back down, but he's still not as happy as he was, I just hope he starts to form some strong bonds again with the new staff.  

We've had a few issues with the nursery in general this month and I've had to have several chats about the quality of care. I was shocked one day to arrive home with Evan only to discover he'd been left in a pooey nappy for what looked like a few hours. His bottom was very sore and I checked his report to find out that his last nappy change that day was 2pm and I collected him at 6pm. A few other parents have also complained and as a result they now get at least 4 nappy changes a day. The most recent issue I have at the moment is that Evan is thirsty when I arrive to collect him from nursery and they assure me that he's allowed to drink whenever he likes, but my issue is that he cannot yet say *"I would like a drink please"*, all he can do is respond to a question or point to the cup if he sees it. When you leave your child with whatever childcare that you use, you want to know that your child is safe and being well looked after. I absolutely loved the nursery he is at, but recently I've started to have concerns, I just hope they get resolved soon.  

We've got to be careful with what we say, Evan is picking up several new words every day now and he only has to hear it once. We were out food shopping this month when I just called out to Caroline to get something and for the remainder of the shopping trip he just kept reciting *"Caroline"*, well it sounded more like *"Carowine"* because Evan is having great difficulty with words that contain *"L"*—lorry, plane and now Caroline.  

I took a day off with Evan this month to get together with all my friends that I met whilst on maternity leave. It was great to see them all and to see how well everyone is developing. We had planned to go to Odds Farm Park, but it was pretty windy and wet that day so we decided to camp out at mine and just let the children play together. We did go for a little walk to the local supermarket to get some food for lunch and that was cute watching all the children with their little walking reigns on. It was a really fun day and it's a real shame that we don't see more of each other. After witnessing Esther use the *"naughty step"*, we decided to start using that technique soon after. We had planned to introduce it when he was older because we thought he wouldn't really understand what we were trying to achieve at this age, but we found it really worked well. He understood what we meant by it straight away. I've used it a few times this month for when Evan really has done things that he knows he must not do and being consistent is key to this working.</value>

  <data name="y2Sep" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Evan and I went to see my mum this month and we stayed overnight so that Evan could see more of his grandma. We had an exhausting but very enjoyable time, my mum would probably echo those thoughts as well. As it happens, she also had a friend visiting from Cornwall but as she was also splitting her time with others, she wasn't at my mums on the days we went. We met at Ikea in Lakeside as that was half way between the location where my mums friend was going to and we fancied a shopping trip anyway, so this was ideal. I found this great chair for Evan at Ikea, it's basically a child version of their fancy bouncing recliner chairs. It is so funky and it had this really nice beige fabric that would go really well in our lounge with our sofas. We really needed to get him a chair as he was starting to climb on the sofa, but it's still too big for him to sit on comfortably. For a while we have been just piling some pillows on the floor for him, but that was probably even more uncomfortable for him, so I am really pleased with this latest purchase.  

Whilst at my mums, Evan and I stayed in her bedroom and I was wondering how well we'd cope in the same room again because at home we can hear most noises that Evan makes in the night through the walls. I was so surprised at how well he slept, I didn't hear a thing from him all night. In fact the only disturbance was the dogs downstairs who kept trying to get into the room where my mum was sleeping.  

Evan has shown a love of lids, he has this fascination with any kind of lid that he can put onto a container. Every morning, we have this routine with all the creams and hair stuff that Caroline and I use. Evan has this sixth sense around lids, he just knows when we are getting one out. He can be sitting quietly by his toy box upstairs and then he'll just jump up and run into the bathroom pointing and shouting lid, it's very cute. He'll then wander around holding it whilst we use the substance and then he'll come and place the lid back onto the container. He does this every day whenever there is a lid in sight.  

Another one of Evan's recent addictions, is that of my slippers. He absolutely loves them. He wasn't very good at putting them on his feet at the beginning of the month and he used to get upset when we tried to help him as well. He persevered and now he can easily step into them and then he'll just wander around with them on, he can move rather fast for a little boy wearing footwear that is far too big for him. It's very funny and cute.  

We went to Legoland again this month to use the free tickets that we were given when we last visited. We decided to only go for the afternoon as we now knew exactly what Evan could and couldn't go on, so we just went to the areas of the park that he could go on. We managed to get on the one ride this time that we never managed to get on last time as the queue was shorter. He seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself again so I think we'll definitely invest in an annual pass next year.  

Evan and I also visited a little farm this month with my mum and it had lots of fun things to do, as well as lots of animals to see. We went into the soft play area, at first I accidentally took him into the older children's area, which was a scary ordeal for me! I was helping him climb and at the time I thought, crikey his legs would go straight through that net, so I just carried him across most of the things and when you only have one hand free and you're balancing on an unstable net about 20ft off the ground with a small child in your arms, it's rather terrifying. After a while I decided that something wasn't right, so we climbed down and then I found the baby soft play area. We saw some huge horses, which Evan found somewhat scary. We did go for a ride on a combine harvester, Evan was unsure initially, but he seemed to enjoy it in the end. I think the bumpy ride and the noise of the engine was what he found scary.  

I think the summer is definitely over now and the dark nights are returning. It's horrible when you wake up in the morning and it's dark, wet and cold outside... It's quite handy that Evan has only just started to out grow his clothes, just as a new season arrives as we would have needed to get him some new clothes anyway.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="y2Oct" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cold nights have really crept up on us this month. Evan was still wearing his summer jacket in the day but I suddenly realised the need for a proper winter coat when I took Evan to watch a local football match one evening early this month. Caroline was out for the evening, so Evan had to come with me. I packed up a bottle of milk for him, hat, jacket and gloves and he even had 3 layers on under the jacket. I just couldn't keep him warm at all; his lips even turned blue! His little teeth were chattering away, I was fairly warm—I guess that's because I have more blood and fat! We stayed for about 20 minutes in the end until all attempts to get him warm failed, so we went home. I was really annoyed at myself and the next day we went out and bought him a great big coat to keep him warm. The problem I have now is he can't wear it in the car because its too big so sometimes when we are rushed we leave the house without it!  

The nursery have been teaching Evan about animals recently because he's fascinated with them and he seems to know all the noises. It's very cute when you are having a conversation and if an animal word that he knows about pops up, he'll repeat it but also make the sound of the animal as well. For example, he'll quite often point to the cats and say *"My cat, mee-ow",* though Caroline will usually repsond with *"umm no, it's my cat"* :). He mimics Cleo very well, she's the cat with the funniest meow I've heard and it's that one that he has chosen to copy. My favourite is probably his fish impression as he does the mouth movement with a very quiet *"Bob Bob"* noise...  

We've started to put extra blankets on his bed at the moment and I'm sure it won't be long before we start using his quilt. The only issue we have is that Evan really dislikes having bedding put over him and he'll kick it off if you try to do it whilst he is awake. The technique I use at the moment is to try and place the thin blanket over him and then cover him up with the thicker fleece blanket later when he is asleep. Sometimes it's just hopeless though because in the morning I'll walk in to see him sleeping on top of everything and with very cold feet!  

Green, Green, Green! Everything is green... Evan has taken a step back with colours recently, if you ask him what colour something is, or if he wants to tell you the colour, everything is green. We'll stop at the traffic lights and he just shouts out *"Green, Green!"*. Sometimes I think he is teasing me because he'll be grinning as he says the wrong colour. He knows the colours though because if I ask him to bring me a blue block or a red ball, he'll bring the correct one to me. But if you ask him afterwards what colour it is, all we get is green!  

Evan has started undressing himself this month. In particular he really dislikes wearing coats and as a result he has become quite adapt at taking that off. He tried to undress himself one evening whilst I was getting his bath ready and the whole scene had me in fits of laughter. I said, *"ok Evan, take your socks off"*. At first he tried to do it standing up, but in the end he sat down. He then tried to pull them up towards him, so I showed him how to pull from the toe end. He grabbed the sock and tried pulling, but he kept falling backwards onto his back with his feet in the air. He's so adorable at times and it made me giggle so much. It won't be long before he's mastered this little art.  

Caroline's mum has never baby sat for us alone whilst Evan was younger because she doesn't really have the strength to deal with him. He's really good these days though being much older as he does a lot more for himself. We asked her how she would feel babysitting on Caroline's birthday so that we could go for a meal with friends and she seemed really keen to help. It was a real success! We got Evan fed, washed and ready for bed before we left and all that he needed was a bottle of milk later on. He played for about an hour before it was time for bed and he was really well behaved for his nanny. He does love spending time with his grand parents and probably gets up to less mischief when we are not there.  

Evan was invited to get this new immunisation that has become available for children under 2. It's been several months since his last injection and I did wonder how he would be now that he is more aware of what was happening. It was absolutely awful and really traumatising for both of us. He managed to free himself from our grip when the needle went in and as the needle flew out of his arm, the nurse stabbed herself in the thumb. I couldn't believe what was happening, Evan was screaming, she was bleeding and I felt absolutely helpless. The situation became worse now as Evan knew what to expect and it took 3 people to restrain him whilst the immunisation was administered again. He had two little holes in his arm so we tried to put a plaster on him. This ended up being just as traumatising as he absolutely hated it. Every time he spotted the plaster, he cried and tried to grab it. In the end I had to take it off for him, so I tried to soak it but it was still stuck on very tightly and removing that made him cry again! My poor baby, the day didn't get any better for him as he had a run in with one of our cats. I was sitting with him by the sofa and I'm not sure what he did to the cat, but the cat got upset and ended up grabbing Evan in a head lock! He had scratches down both sides of his face, really close to his eyes! We had lots of cuddles that day to try and make it all better...  

I had a moment of madness at the end of the month. Evan seems to follow me everywhere these days, he'll be happily playing and it's as if he has this sixth sense that alerts him to when I have left the room as he will only be a minute or so behind me to find out where I have gone. I'd just arrived home with pizza one evening and left Caroline eating it in the lounge. I told Evan to go play with her whilst I disappeared upstairs to get some washing. I'd just finished collecting the washing when I heard the distinct patter of a little boy at the stairs. I rushed to the top to see Evan half way up. He stopped as soon as he saw me, so I dropped everything and descended the stairs to get to him. He then decided to try and go down backwards at the same time. I stopped suddenly not knowing what to do because as I descended he copied me. I should have rushed but I panicked and in the end I stayed motionless just watching hoping that if I watched him carefully he wouldn't fall. He stood up about 5 steps from the bottom and I gasped trying to stop him with my words. It was hopeless, he stumbled and lost his balance, falling backwards. I screamed as I saw him bounce on his neck at the bottom. I flew down the stairs to see him with this sheer look of horror on his face, as if he was holding his breath. I was relieved when he did finally cry. Caroline was there in seconds as well, but I couldn't believe what I allowed to happen. I stripped him down, but he appeared to look in one piece, the only mark was redness on his shoulder which I guess was where the impact of the fall hit. This incident left me with nightmares and days of guilt. I still haven't fully forgiven myself as he really could have injured himself with a fall like that. I'm now very vigilant and doors are always closed behind me when I leave Evan in another room.</value>

    <value>It's been a funny old month this month. I've been so busy, yet I don't really have much to show for it. Evan and I had some time off unexpectedly this month due to him being a little bit poorly. Normally when he's not allowed to go to nursery it's not because he is really ill, but it's just to protect the other children and he'll spend most of the time at home running around playing. This time though, it was obvious that he was in discomfort, he wanted lots of cuddles and attention. I did manage to find some good ways to distract him though, we printed off lots of pictures from the CBeebies website and we sat and coloured them in. Chuck in a couple of home drawn horses and spiders and you've got one content little Evan. CBeebies have a great website, the games keep Evan amused so easily, though I'm the one that actually has to play it for him. It'll be better for him when he can actually do it all. He's quite good though, if I say to him to press the space bar, he knows exactly what to do.  

He has this obsession with spiders *(not real ones)*, he just wants you to draw spiders and play the spider game with your hand. I discovered the hard way that it wasn't real spiders that he was interested in :). I took him upstairs to get bathed one day and there was this tiny spider on the ceiling in the corner above the bath. I said too Evan *"Oooh look Evan, a real spider..."* When he looked up from inside the bath, he just freaked out and decided that minute that he didn't want to be in there anymore....Now every time we go into the bathroom, he says *"Spider gone"* because he knows it's not there anymore.  

We visited his great nan in Birmingham this month and he finally met his great uncle for the first time ever. My uncle always seems to be working when we visit, but we managed to time it just right this time. It was a good day, but unfortunately this was the day when Evan became ill, so he was very clingy and in a lot of discomfort.  

My other nan had an accident at her nursing home this month, she broke her leg nastily above the knee and she needed an operation to save it. She did give us a little scare that week and I've spent some time this month visiting her to make sure she's alright. She's back at the nursing home now recovering from the operation, but we're all still worried because she might fall over again doing herself even more damage.  

We went Christmas and birthday shopping for Evan this month and decided it would be easier to take him with us than arrange a baby sitter. Plus it was a good way to find out if he really did like the things we were looking to get him. I wanted to get him a lot of Lego this year, to benefit from the Free Annual Pass to Legoland if you spend a certain amount in one day at the shop. It seems a bit extreme but it was definitely worth it because an Annual Pass to Legoland is £60. He spent the whole time running around just looking at things in amazement and attempting to carry it all over to Caroline to show her. We managed to get most of the things for our Lego Thomas the Tank Engine train set, except for the Thomas section, but hopefully he'll be satisfied with the others as he has all of them.  

Evan has this new thing that he has started doing in the bath. He has chosen to start lying down on his front so that he can kick his feet and play that way in the bath. Luckily the day he chose to do that for the first time was a day when there wasn't so much water in the bath and lying down didn't give him any problems with water reaching his mouth. I wasn't sure if it was a one off at first but now every bath time he seems to spend some of the time on his belly playing.</value>

    <value>It's birthday time! This year has flown by and Evan has grown up so much. He's now this little boy who chats—a lot!  

We popped over to our neighbours to deliver Christmas cards and presents one weekend this month and Evan had so much fun playing with their daughter, who is about 9 months younger than Evan. Watching them together is so much fun, she just hangs on to him and uses him to climb up onto her feet and he just seems to tower over her. He was so excited that he just kept rushing around when he manages to trip on the laminated flooring and went head first into the coffee table. I've heard him cry before, but this was something else. It was very evident seconds later why he screamed so much. This big bulging bruise appeared on his temple and he developed a black eye. It looked horrific and we struggled to get a cold compress on him. Luckily for us all, it was just a lot of bruising and thankfully it was all gone by the time Christmas and his birthday arrived!  

Evan can count! He can count from 2 to 10, not sure why he misses out 1, but still that is such a good achievement. He knows the numbers as well, we'll often count objects in his books or toys and he can just pick the correct number, the lower ones are easiest e.g. 2, 3 and 4. I'm very impressed with him though.  

We went to his friend Megan's birthday party the weekend before Christmas and he had such a good time. He absolutely loved it, he just got on with everyone and played really nicely. He absolutely loved the kitchen area and spent a lot of time there with Alex and James cooking—typical boys! For days afterwards he was still saying *"Megan's party"* and *"Megan's cake"*.  

So many presents! Christmas was nice and quiet at Caroline's mum's house. We all ate really well, especially Evan, he just couldn't get enough of her cooking—it was delicious. We could tell he was eating well because he did a lot of poos! We decided not to take any toys with us for the Christmas/ birthday break as he'd be getting lots of presents. We did take one of his favourite toys—his Postman Pat van, so that he had something to play with until Christmas Day. We also knew he'd be at Nanny's wooden spoons and pots as well. We decided to spread the presents out, so we actually gave him some on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day because we were all experiencing little boring moments with not much to do.  

Evan slept really badly at Caroline's mum's over Christmas and we couldn't work out why. He just wouldn't go to sleep and would be crying on and off all night, he even got up and sat with us several times in the evening until he finally crashed at about 10.30pm. It didn't occur to me until on our way to my mum's for Boxing Day *(his birthday)* that maybe it was the day time nap that was the reason for him not sleeping. He'd been getting up late in the morning and still sleeping for 2 hours so no wonder he wasn't tired. We were right though, he doesn't have day time naps anymore unless he's at nursery, but that's only because we have to get him up early and he does get worn out there.  

Evan had even more presents for his birthday, there was a huge pile at his Grandma's and that was before we added ours to it! He knew what it was all about now though. When he saw the presents his reaction was—wow! and he just couldn't wait to open them. His favourite by far has to be the Lego Animal Zoo, he just loves the animals. He'll demand that I build it and then he'll just stack all the animals, with the poor mummy elephant at the bottom. Since Christmas, he has shown no interest in TV and that's a good thing—he would throw a tantrum when I wouldn't let him watch CBeebies, so I'm glad he's more interested in his toys now. He didn't quite understand it was his birthday, we brought the cake out and started singing happy birthday to him. He helped me blow the candles out but as soon as he finished he kept saying it was Megan's cake and we couldn't get him to understand that it was actually his, *cutie...*  

This month has been absolutely brilliant, it compares as good as the busy month we had in the Summer when we did lots of family trips. I love Christmas time especially now that I have a happy family to share it with. I loved every minute of it and I just loved having the tree up with all the decorations. Christmas truly is a lovely time of year, it's a shame global warming has stopped it from snowing!  

Evan was such a good little boy, he was so cute one evening that he just sat on Caroline's lap watching me play GTA attempting to complete a mission that Caroline was struggling with, that he just fell asleep... so adorable. He's definitely a cheeky little boy as well. He discovered the chocolates on the Christmas tree when my mum was looking after him one day when he was ill. That day, he didn't know what to do so he asked her to unwrap the tin foil wrapping. It didn't take him long to figure it out, I must have caught him eating about 4 over the Christmas break. It was quite amusing and although I never took it off him, I tried to explain to him to ask me first, but he never did. I'm just glad that one was enough—he only ever took one off the tree, per day. I did tell him off the day he knocked the tree over though! He'd eaten all the chocolates low down on the tree and was struggling to find them when he must have leant into it knocking it over. It landed away from him luckily, but it did break a couple of baubles so we'll be needing to stock up for next year!  

Happy New Year to you all and may 2007 be a great year for everyone!</value>
