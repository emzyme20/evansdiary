    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>We all went to the dentist this month for our 6 month check up. Last time Evan didn't have as many teeth so a simple smile and giggle was enough to let the dentist check them. This time around he has all of his child teeth except for the final set of molars. I'd been practicing with Evan for the week before opening our mouths and saying *"Aaaah"*. I thought we had it sussed but when we attempted to do it for the dentist Evan became shy and refused.  

Caroline went in first, while I amused Evan in the waiting room. We were having so much fun until drama erupted in style. He managed to stumble on the carpet and fell into the base of the waiting room seats. They had these carpeted bases and it resulted in Evan getting a nasty carpet burn graze on his forehead that stayed for several days. We did manage to let the dentist see his teeth afterwards and she said he had a lovely set.  

Evan has been having visits to the next room at nursery as he is now the oldest in his current room and the other children are much younger than him. There was a little group of them that loved playing together and one by one they have all been moving up into the 2-3 year old room—Evan being the last one to move. He loves the visits because he much prefers to play with the older children. I feel sorry for the little girls in that room, it's so noisy and there are only 2 or 3 girls in total! The boys are quite boisterous.  

We had our first down pour of snow this month since the mini blizzard we had on Evan's 1st birthday. Evan was mesmerised by all the white stuff and it stayed longer on the ground this time. He loved it, we left for work later than usual because we spent several minutes making pretty footprint patterns in the snow. It was great, though it only lasted for the day. We arrived at nursery and it was a battle to get him inside and we used a snowball as bait. The only downside was him then throwing it at one of the nursery ladies! Everyone saw the funny side of it. Apparently he had a lovely day playing in the snow at every opportunity—I wish I'd been able to enjoy it with him.  

Evan is becoming quite the little chatterbox these days and in the car he can be quite demanding. He insists on you answering him every time and if you don't he'll just repeat Mummy over and over again until you respond. Sometimes I'll look at him waiting for him to continue the conversation but he insists on you saying the words *"Yes, Evan?"*. It's hard work, but he loves to chat *(wonder where he gets that from!).*  

We have abandoned the naughty step, instead we now use a naughty corner. We use the steps to help put his shoes on, so it had a conflict on interests there. We didn't want Evan to think he was being disciplined when we wanted to put his shoes on. The steps also have a lot of things that distract him and we started to notice that he'd just sit there and play with the phone or coats whilst he was sitting out his 2 minutes. This also meant we had no form of time out when he was naughty upstairs as we didn't have any steps handy. We've decided that a naughty corner is more appropriate and we have places that can be used whether we are upstairs or downstairs. He really hates the naughty corner as well and we're starting to see it working because he shows signs of regret when his time out ends and he always apologises.</value>

    <value>I've been a bit repetitive of late when it comes to the music that I've been listening to in the car when there is nothing interesting to listen to on the radio. I've especially enjoyed listening to a mix CD that I compiled with some Snow Patrol, The Feeling and The Kooks—oh and some retro song that I heard on the radio (Ain't Nobody by Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan). Evan seems to enjoy it too as he always bops his legs and gets his Piglet teddy bear dancing in the car when the songs are playing. This month however I started to notice him singing along to them—he actually gets some of the words right and it's really amazing. He even recognises them when they come on the radio. He's started singing a lot in general, his favourite songs from TV are the Bob the Builder theme tune and Postman Pat.  

Swimming is now on hold for the foreseeable future, we'll probably try him again in the summer. We've been going to Windsor recently as it has a fairly big family pool and it's more local than the Langley one. It has a cool wave machine as well, but Evan finds that a little scary. On a recent visit to Windsor Leisure Centre Evan decided that he really didn't want to go swimming. We had a battle to get his armbands on and that just made the whole situation worse and I don't think he ever recovered. I persevered with him, cuddling him, carrying him, trying to relax him a little and although it worked for about 5 minutes, he then spent the next 20 minutes crying. In the end he grabbed my hand and said *"Mummy, home..."* so we went home. That was one of the most expensive 30 minutes I have had recently, so we won't be doing that for a while. I may look into swimming lessons to help build up his confidence, but again, I'll wait until the summer before trying that.  

We had more snow this month and Evan remembered it! He absolutely loved it, especially when our neighbour came over to have a mini snowball fight with us one morning. It's a real shame it did not hang around for any length of time—I love the snow.  

The constant *"No!"* to everything has become rather irritating lately and we decided to do something about it, so every time Evan said *"No"* for whatever reason, he spent 2 minutes in the naughty corner. We were getting *"No"* 20 times a day for silly things, for example I'd say to Evan, *"would you like some milk Evan?"* and he'd reply with *"no"*.  I knew he didn't mean it, but I went along with it and put it away, he'd then cry and throw a tantrum saying *"My milk!"*. It was getting ridiculous. I was surprised at how quickly he learned that the naughty corner came after behaving like that. By the end of the first day, he'd stopped! We still get the occasional episode, but nothing like it was.  

We ventured out into the garden this month to start pruning in time for Spring. It was so dirty, yukky yukky... Evan absolutely loved being able to run around, though he was a little intrigued by the broken fence panel that now gives us access to our neighbour's garden. I hope that gets fixed soon otherwise I can see that being a nightmare.  

We had a little accident this month with Evan that resulted in a visit to Accident &amp; Emergency. Evan and I had just returned home from work and we were saying hello to Caroline in the hallway. I was just having a cuddle and conversation when Evan started to play up and force his way between us to get attention. We tried to move him out of the way and he somehow managed to get caught up in my legs and feet and he fell over hitting his head on the groove of the front door that goes inwards. He fell unexpectedly and his head took all the impact. I managed to pick him up in an instant and was horrified to see the huge bump appear instantly on his temple. The most disturbing memory I have is of his eyes disappearing and rolling around, it was as if he'd lost consciousness. I was terrified and it took what seemed like ages for him to cry. A cold compress wasn't helping and in the end I grabbed a bottle of milk and we rushed him to A&amp;E. We were there for a few hours so that they could just watch him and by the end of the night he was running around causing chaos showing off a great big shiner of a bruise on the side of his head. I was relieved the following morning when Evan woke up. Head injuries are really awful and the smallest bump can be very dangerous.  

Evan is really getting into his puzzles at the moment, surprisingly he's actually rather good at them and can figure out some of the basic ones all by himself. He only needs the occasional prompt from me for the more complicated puzzles. If I hand him a piece, he can usually figure out where it goes.</value>

    <value>Now that Spring has finally settled we've started compiling a list of places that we'd like to take Evan to this year. We're hoping to do something with Evan every weekend so that he doesn't get bored, whether it's going to see family and friends, visiting a local attraction like the indoor play area or going out of our way to visit something completely new. I'm looking forward to Marwell Zoo as it's been so long since I've been to a Zoo and I'm looking forward to seeing the Giraffes and Elephants *(Hopefully they'll have some!).*  

The first place we visited this year was Beale Park. We went with some friends who have a son near Evan's age hoping that they'd play together. He was older than Evan and he was influencing Evan's choices very early on. Everything that this little boy did, Evan wanted to do—even launching sticks and stones into the ponds, which was frowned upon! The best attraction at Beale Park was probably the steam train that you can ride on, though Caroline will probably disagree as this made her sneeze a lot because she didn't like the smell. They had lots of wildlife for us to see, but not the sorts of animals that you'll see at a Zoo, we saw lots of birds, owls and farm animals. There were other animals but I spent most of my time chasing Evan around as all he wanted to do was run off. There was a Giant play area with a sand pit and lots of play houses and ride on toys to play with. I spent ages at this area especially pushing Evan really high on the swing—he loved it. It was a really long day but Evan seemed to enjoy himself, and that's the plan.  

Evan spent two weekends with his grandma this month because Caroline and I had made plans to go Ice-Skating one weekend with some friends and we also had her work's Christmas Party in Bristol. One of the weekends tied in nicely as it was my mum's birthday, so we were all able to spend some time with her and then Evan stayed a little longer. I'd been planning for a few months to do a Photo Book of Evan as one of her presents. It came out really nice, though some of the pages had the pictures and text a little too close to the edge, something I'll be wary of next time I design one. It contained a selection of images, some my mum had already seen and a load of new pictures. I was worried it would just be repeating pictures she'd already seen and had copies of, but she seemed to really like it.  

We had another visit to A&amp;E this month. I was at work when I got the phone call that every mother dreads. Evan fell into a door frame at nursery splitting open his lip and it was quite deep. Debbie was very calm on the phone saying that it may need some stitches and that I should come to see him as soon as possible. I wasn't sure what to expect and I thought he'd be back at nursery in the afternoon. How wrong I was :). As soon as I saw him, I started crying, the cut went down into his chin and it was still bleeding when I got there. I just picked him up and drove him to A&amp;E as quickly as I could. I phoned Caroline on my *"hands free"* and I struggled to get any coherent words out. I told her not to worry and that I'd call her later, I'm so glad she ignored my advice because I needed her there really. When the Doctor's took a look at his face they said he needed proper stitches as the stick on butterfly ones would fall off and he'd be left with a larger scar. I didn't understand at first what they were saying when they were discussing the possibility of him having to wait until the next day for the stitches. Then they explained that to do stitches on a child as young as Evan, he'd need to have a general anaesthetic. I was horrified and speechless.  

We had to wait until the afternoon because he'd eaten some food at 9am and you needed to have an empty stomach before he could go to the Operating Room. Caroline went in with him because I didn't want to witness them putting him to sleep. He cuddled her and they applied the anaesthetic that way; she said he just groaned and then fell asleep. The procedure didn't take too long, but he had to spend a while in the recovery room. He was very grumpy and upset when Caroline went to collect him and he cried a lot for the next 90 minutes. We finally managed to get him to drink and eat and then we were allowed to take him home. We monitored him closely for the next 48 hours because the anaesthetic stays in your body for that amount of time. I know this won't be the last time, but I certainly didn't expect this to happen when he was only 2. He still remembers the event and talks about falling over and hurting his lip. He had dissolvable stitches because if he hadn't, he would have had another general anaesthetic to remove them.  

We witnessed another milestone this month. I'd just bathed Evan and I was trying to put a little talc on him afterwards. He thought this was a really funny game, so I spent the next 10 minutes chasing a naked baby around tickling him and dabbing talc on him. We were finally exhausted and Evan said *"poo Mummy"*. I said *"Ok, lets quickly put a nappy on then"* but he said *"No Mummy, potty".* I was really surprised as he hadn't wanted to use the potty at all lately so I watched him pull it out, though he faced it away from me. I just sat and waited for him to finish. When he stood up, we both peered in and he'd done his first wee! I gave him a great big kiss and a cuddle and we clapped lots. I doubt this will be a regular event, but it's a start.</value>

    <value>We had an interesting start to this month when we visited Caroline's mum for the Easter weekend. She'd been planning a little visit to a public garden that has lots of flowers and special gardens for the public to come and see. I hadn't really thought too much about it until the actual day. Usually when we go out with Evan, there is two of us on hand to deal with him as he does have a tendency to wander and get upto general mischief. Today was going to be slighty different as Caroline's mum now requires a wheelchair when out and about for long periods of time so I was given the task of handling Evan, the pushchair and all the bags whilst Caroline pushed her mother in the wheelchair. This day could have been a sketch out of Benny Hill because at one point Evan had me running round the gardens chasing him and abandoning the pushchair. Evan is definitely showing his independence at the moment, he wanted to be in control of pushing the pushchair even when we were trying to squeeze between groups of people and ponds! I was beginning to wish we were at home when things took a turn for the worse. We'd just navigated down this woodchip path when Caroline had the wheelchair wheels stuck and I was behind them with the pushchair. Evan slipped out of my grip and walked passed them and I got the pushchair stuck trying to follow him. Everything happened so quickly, one second I shouted for Evan to stop *(he totally ignored that request)*, then I ran but before I could get to him he just stepped straight into the baby pond *(luckily for us it was only the baby one)*. I caught him just as he slipped on the plastic base, he fell in up to his waist and my foot slipped in too. I screamed and everyone around us gasped in horror as I pulled out this drenched baby. He response was *"Oh dear, wet"*—yes no kidding!  

We didn't have anything with us, nappies or spare clothes as we haven't really found the need for them now that he is much older. We were just removing his wet clothes and debating the next action we could take when a lovely lady wandered over to us to ask if we had any clothes for him. She gave us a spare pair of jogging bottoms to use as her son was of a similar age. I couldn't thank her enough, we were able to stay for a little while longer and Evan was quite content to stay in his pushchair as he had no shoes or socks and his nappy was fat and wet because it had absorbed the pond water.  

The deadline to get the annual passes for Legoland was the end of April, so we went to Legoland again this month. Evan is now at the next height range, so he can go on more of the rides. We only had two minor incidents that day, both around the same time. Once again Evan slipped out of my grasp and I thought he was with us, when suddenly I realised that neither one of us had him. I can't explain the feelings I experienced for the next few minutes, my heart was in my throat and I just panicked. I ran back the way we came shouting his name and fortunately for us, he'd not wandered far and he did come when he heard me shout. I don't think he realised he was lost and if he had then it may have been a worse situation for us all. I don't think I recovered from this incident all day. The second incident slightly more embarrassing for me was on the ride we were queuing for when he got lost. When we reached the front there was only two spaces left. Caroline took Evan on and I stayed in the queue because he could then get a second ride with me free. This seemed like a good idea until I got in and Caroline transferred him to me. When she left, Evan just cried his eyes out calling *"My Mummy"* and pointing to Caroline as she wandered off. I couldn't console him and in the end we had to leave the ride. The ride assistants were saying *"Oh I guess he wants his mummy"*, I just smiled and said *"yeah, I guess so"*, thinking to myself *I AM HIS MUMMY...* I have no idea why he cried and Caroline was equally puzzled when she saw that we weren't on the ride as it went round.  

Evan has been going through a phase lately that I can only describe as him trying to push us to see how much protesting and refusals he can get away with. The main issue has been at the dinner table when it comes to food time. He's not too keen on meat at the moment especially mince, he'd rather eat pasta and ham every day if he had his way. I served him up a meal that is probably not his favourite but it's not horrible either—chilli and rice. I'm not going to cook any more mince meals for a while but I didn't want to waste them either so he has to finish what is in the freezer. He just refused to eat this meal and we had tantrums like I have never seen before. I think he spent 2 hours at the table that day before finally eating his meal and all three of us were exhausted afterwards. He hasn't tried that since so I think it was worth enduring the pain as it showed him that he does not rule us.  

We finished this month with a BBQ at our friends house. Evan was well behaved and we all had a nice time. The last time we were there, we spent the whole time chasing him around because he was still a bit wobbly on his feet and we were worried about him hurting himself in their garden. This time round, he was fine. We played football with him and they also have a new dog that is much more friendly, so he would play with her and leave the other dog alone. If only I had the digital camcorder handy when we'd just packed up outside for the evening. Evan was standing in the kitchen asking to go outside to play football. I said it was too late and that it was time to start getting ready for bed, Evan however, decided he had other ideas. He wandered into the utility room and stood by the back door, so I left him. I only investigated when I heard this clattering noise and when I glanced in, I just screamed in shock as all I saw was a pair of legs dangling from the dog flap. I grabbed his legs and pulled him back in, how was I to know that he'd be that sneaky in finding a way outside!—Cheeky monkey...</value>

  <data name="y3May" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>May has been the month of first times. Caroline went to Wales with her Karate club for a week of intensive training. I was really looking forward to this as it meant I was going to have to do everything by myself. We're a really good team and you only realise how much each other does when you're left alone to do it all. She went on the Bank Holiday weekend so Evan and I were left to our own devices on the Bank Holiday Monday :). I spent a few hours cooking all the food required for the weeks lunches and the evening meals for Evan and I. I always feel the urge to do house maintenance when Caroline isn't around as it's usually something which she doesn't allow and this was no exception. 2 hours later, I had some university certificates up on the wall, which now have to stay on the wall because I also have them covering up 2 holes in the wall where my first attempts went wrong! Evan was playing with his Bob the Builder puzzles whilst I was doing DIY *(also remembering why we don't really do any)* when I hit my thumb with the hammer, he was very caring when he saw it happen because he wandered over to examine my thumb saying *"Oh dear, mummy hurt finger".*  

Evan had an appointment with an Allergy Clinic this month to run some tests to see whether his intolerance to tomatoes is actually an allergy. I decided to take a nappy with me just in case as it was an afternoon appointment and he hadn't done a poo all day. I was secretly hoping that he'd hold out though and risked not taking wipes because I couldn't fit them in my bag. He really liked the play area at the hospital and it must have excited him so much that he did in fact do the poo that I was hoping he wouldn't. I only realised when we walked in to see the Doctor because it really did smell. That room was unbearable for our 15 minute consultation. The allergy test consisted of several blobs of solution and one real sample of tomato placed on the inside of his forearm. The Doctor drew markings next to each blob so we knew which one was which and then he used a spiky utensil to make a pin prick in his arm over the solutions. Evan was unfazed by this and just thought the Doctor was tickling him. We then went off to wait for the solutions to react with his skin.  

I was then challenged with changing Evan's nappy. All was going well until I realised I had no wipes, the only thing I had available was some facial wipes! These had to do, Evan's bum smelled all fresh and rosey after that!  

The results of the allergy concluded that he doesn't have an allergic reaction, but his body is showing an intolerance to them. There is not a lot that we can do about it except try him on tomatoes again when he is 5 to see if he is still sick. If he's sick still, then we can probably conclude that he won't be able eat tomatoes at all in the future.  

I had some bad news to take this month as my nan died. Even though she was 93, it was still a shock for me when I found out. She always seemed ok when I went to visit, maybe that was because I always had Evan with me as that always made her happy. She rarely knew who I was these days, often mistaking me for my mum, but it was still nice to see her. Evan would usually just run up and down dancing and jumping. I used to get him to sing to her and she'd clap her hands to him. After my nan survived the operation last year to fix her broken leg, I really thought she'd survive so much more, I didn't realise that it was to be her downfall eventually. Even though it was hard to visit her lately because she didn't know who you were, I still miss her deeply. I'm already forgetting what she looked like and the images I do have seem to clash, one minute I see a flash that represents the frail lady I've been used to seeing recently and then I see a flash of her as I wish she had stayed with dark black hair and her strong personality. I don't think she had a very good quality of life lately and I feel bad for wanting her to stick around just for us. She was my nan though and I loved her no matter what. Just like when she was going to have an operation, we all gathered round her just in case she didn't survive, I wish I'd been able to say goodbye this time. You never know when will be the last time you see someone and I remember my last visit vividly and as we always did, Evan and I said goodbye and waved and then I looked back saying *"See you soon Nan, take care.."* little did I realise that that was not going to be the case. It's times like this when you feel like you need to be around family more, it makes me hate the distance between my mum and I. I wish we only lived 15 minutes away from each other so that we could see each other weekly.  

Evan and I took the long drive to Birmingham this month to see my nan who lives there. We'd had this trip planned for a month so it wasn't a last minute trip arranged after my other nan died. I haven't seen Nan Olive since November, a little longer than I had planned because I'd changed jobs and our weekends had been really busy lately so I was worried that Evan might be shy around her. He was absolutely fine though, she greeted us at the gate and he didn't hesitate to go hand in hand with her down her garden path whilst I unloaded the car. It was a really lovely day and Evan was such a good little boy. It won't be as long until the next visit as we'll see her again next month at my brother's wedding.  

Let's hope June brings happier memories... I'm dedicating this entry to my Nan Yates, who I lost this month. She'll never be forgotten and I just only wish I had some pictures to remember her by as I'm worried that over time her image in my memories will fade.</value>

    <value>__*"Bienvenue à l'édition en Français!"*__  

Well—not quite! The month started and ended with a French event. My speech is somewhat better but I can't really write it. We were invited to a BBQ at Caroline's brother's house at the end of May. This BBQ was special as her relatives from France had travelled over for a long weekend and this would be the first time that I met them. It was a really lovely day despite the terrible weather that we had and I just wish I could have chatted with them, however they didn't really speak English. We chose this day to trial the new in car DVD player that I purchased to help keep Evan occupied on our trip to France at the end of June. I didn't intend to use it in the car, mainly for the aeroplane and whilst we were out there. Evan seemed to be doing well until about 25 minutes into the journey when he took the headphones off and looked as though he might fall asleep. We couldn't turn the DVD player off so it just carried on playing. It all went horribly wrong when Evan started to cry and out of no-where he was sick everywhere. I was on the M25 at this time and it was raining so hard, we had luckily brought some spare clothes with us this time as we're learning from the baby in the pond incident earlier in the year. We ended up stripping Evan off at the side of the road to change his clothes and then I tried to clean the car as best I could with just a handful of wipes at my disposal. The rest of the journey was just as unpleasant as the smell was awful. Now that was an expensive way to discover that your child suffers from travel sickness!</value>

    <value>We finally made the trip to a Zoo as this is one place I wanted to go to last year but we never quite made it. Evan absolutely loved it, although I was disappointed that he didn't get to see his favourite animal *"the Elephant"* because Marwell Zoo doesn't have them. We didn't arrive until after lunch time, but we still managed to squeeze the whole Zoo in. The weather was fantastic, possibly a little too hot as the poor animals spent a lot of the time under trees resting. The Giraffes were fantastic but they'd just been fed so they weren't so close to the viewing platform. Caroline's favourite was the Tiger, it came right over to us and growled, still such a beautiful cat though. I fell for the Snow Leopards, they very great. The saddest part of the day was reading about all the animals facing extinction, some are actually now extinct in the wild. Can you imagine a world with only humans—at this rate this is exactly what it will be like unless we start taking care of the environment that we live in.</value>

    <value>Mr brother and his fiancé Pascale got married at the end of June. We did try to get Evan there in one piece, it all went pear shaped when I arrived to collect him from nursery the night before only to see that he was now sporting a nice black eye. Evan had decided it would be a good idea to dive on some pillows earlier in the day, the only issue being he missed them.  

The wedding happened to be on the day before we flew to France for our small break. We left it a little late to leave because we wanted to check in online and that has to be done 24 hours before your scheduled flight. We were staying at the fantastic wedding venue that night, so this was our only chance to check in online. We set off, the weather miserable and the Google Map directions not really helping us. I must have travelled up and down the A33 trying to find the turning a couple of times before we suddenly realised that we were at a different point in the directions completely.  

I spent a lot of time thinking about the wedding beforehand as it would be the first time in 5 years that I will have seen my dad, the last time being a snowy evening before he left for Spain. I was determined not to ruin my brother's special day but my dad and I still have unresolved issues and we probably always will because neither one of us will back down. I wasn't sure how I was going to handle the whole Evan issue and it wasn't until I had a chat with my mum that she convinced me that maybe I should introduce them. So not to confuse Evan, I just said *"Evan this is my dad".*  

The day went really well and it didn't start raining until after all the pictures were taken and we were all inside eating. Pascale looked absolutely stunning and Neil scrubbed up well too :), it was a beautiful wedding. We managed to keep Evan awake most of the evening, in fact he had me dancing on the dance floor right up to the moment I decided it was time for bed—I was as shattered as him. The whole babysitting didn't go as planned, we were all going to do a shift *(Caroline, my mum and me)*. Poor Caroline ended up staying with him the whole night because when I popped up to trade, she was in bed and didn't really want to go downstairs on her own. It was a real shame as the night was a really good one.</value>

    <value>The trip to France was our first holiday in 7 years and our first holiday with Evan. No more relaxing in the sun holidays for us! Evan was so excited about the aeroplane, though Caroline did wonder how he'd react when he saw that they were bigger *(much bigger)* than the toy ones that he is used to playing with. We arrived at the airport with a fair amount of time to spare and were informed the flight was delayed. Evan had a real issue with the baggage as he didn't like his toys disappearing down the conveyor belt to the plane. We had lots of tears and I had real difficulty calming him down.  

We'd had a big breakfast at the Hotel but were starting to feel hungry, so we found a restaurant to eat at. We ordered and waited only to discover that our plane was now boarding. We weren't able to cancel the food as it arrived shortly after so we rushed down a few mouthfuls whilst we waited for the bill and then ran as fast as we could to the gate. What a waste of money—our poor pizza was sitting at the table hardly touched and I wasn't anticipating a great meal on the plane.  

We had to catch a bus to the aeroplane to board as they didn't have a proper gate for us to board from so Evan was able to see the plane up close and personal. We had terrible weather leaving Gatwick, the plane actually took off in a thunder storm which caused really scary turbulence through the black clouds where we even witnessed lightning that looked extremely close. Caroline and I suffered with ear problems for most of the flight but Evan seemed ok and only cried when the plane descended into Marseille Airport.  

The holiday in France was lovely, we had great weather and we were looked after really well by Caroline's cousins. I was a bit nervous about all the driving and after discovering where they lived, down a steep gravel track the size of a car where half way down you have to cross the river they own—how cool is that! I'd like to own half of a river! Crossing the river was the most nerve wracking piece of driving I had to do all week and I had to do it twice every day! The bridge was so narrow, I nearly crashed straight into it once.  

We took to the French way of living really easily and we made sure that we found something interesting to do every day ranging from walking, shopping and one day we rented a boat on the lake. It really was a fun week and we found it really easy to relax—when Evan wasn't running off that was. It was very quiet and so dark at night time that you couldn't see without a torch that even Caroline managed to get a good nights sleep and that was with Evan sleeping in the room with us.  

I managed to break the water twice whilst we were there, all I did was turn the tap and nothing happened, fortunately they had a back up supply from the river. Caroline became a star fly-swatter in her spare time. I was really sad when it was time to go home, shedding a few tears in the process. I guess I just had this sinking feeling it would be raining at home and this would probably be our last holiday for a while now that we're poor.  

On our final day we set off at a reasonable time (2pm) aiming to be in Marseille for 4pm, leaving us 90 minutes to get checked in. The journey to Pascale and Jacque's house wasn't so bad because we were given a car with GPS, the only real issue was when Evan was sick 5 miles from their house. We'd managed to clean the car up, but I was nervous that if the same happened on the return journey we'd be in trouble because we wouldn't have time to clean the car. Caroline had figured how to get the GPS to speak in English, so at least that was easier to navigate with. The journey went rather smoothly until I approached Marignane. We weren't able to plug in the airport to the GPS so it was directing us to the town. We were only a few miles away when the familiar screams from the back convinced me to pull over very quickly. Evan was very sick, but this time we managed to get him out of the car first.  

This was only the start of our problems. We got lost in the town and Evan attempted to be sick again and we finally had to ask for directions to get to the airport. We arrived at the airport with less than an hour until take off. We then got lost in the airport and by the time we found the check in desk, she informed us that it had closed. We wandered around and finally found the BA help desk who made the lady check us in despite her insisting that it was closed. It then took us 30 minutes to get through security. Our flight had the final calls for boarding being displayed on the TV screens so we ran as fast as we could to the gate. I carried Evan in my arms—he thought this was an exhilarating adventure. When we got to the gate there was no plane, I was shattered and very stressed! I sat on the floor in pieces thinking about our luggage that was on the plane and the fact that we were sitting here. Caroline wandered about and I was trying to make a phone call when she came rushing back saying that we were at the wrong gate. I threw everything into the bag, this time lacking the energy to pick Evan up. The three of us ran to the correct gate, which happened to be the furthest away from the one we were currently at. All I remember is shouting *"Run Evan, Run as fast as you can"*, he just kept giggling because it was so exciting for him. We did make it to the plane, luckily it had been delayed as we arrived 15 minutes after it was due to take off.  

The return flight was much better than the initial flight with neither one of us experiencing ear problems.

    <value>Evan had a birthday party to go to today as a friend from nursery was having her 3rd birthday. I wasn't particularly prepared for this as we'd only just come back from our holiday in France. Nevertheless, I still managed to get a present and card during my lunch break in the week leading up to the date. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I figured it would be something like the birthday party that he went to at Christmas time.  

Evan had a nice sleep in the car on the way to the party so I hoped he'd last the few hours without getting too tired. As we approached the Community Hall where the party was being hosted I spotted a huge bouncy castle inside. *"OMG!"* was my initial reaction. This bouncy castle was the main feature and Evan has a thing about them, being that he won't go anywhere near them. His friend Rachel and her daddy came to great us and Evan just burst into tears and dug his feet into the ground refusing to go into the hall. I was apologetic and in the end they had to leave us outside while I tried to reason with him. ...Time ticked on...  

...After about 10 minutes I finally persuaded him to come with me, so I picked him up and we walked inside. Obviously Evan decided that it was a little too much to take so now we had a screaming baby inside the hall and I could feel the colour filling in my face. I walked him over to the play mat area where we had the secondary toys—your standard cars and farm animals with a little play house. After a few minutes and the occasional glance at the bouncy castle to check that it hadn't moved, Evan started to settle. He spent the whole afternoon in between eating and pass the parcel, playing with this set of toys. He kept saying *"wow look mummy, a slide"* because there was an inflatable slide attachment on the bouncy castle that the children loved. I said *"Yep it's great, don't you want to join in?"... "No mummy I don't!"* was the assertive response I received back.  

He did seem to have a fun time once we'd overcome the initial bouncy castle horror. I've no idea where he has this fear from, he's only ever seen a bouncy castle a few times and we've never been able to get him to go on them. We had one moment when they let the bouncy castle deflate whilst the children ate because it was so noisy when pumped up. Evan was relieved to see it flat, but as soon as they re-inflated it, he cried like he had earlier. I couldn't help but laugh. They supplied these really cool looking bubble wrap sheets with giant bubbles that the children could stamp on to make pop. There were some children that didn't like this and wouldn't put their feet on them, I wasn't surprised to see Evan fall into that category as well... I'm glad he doesn't like the big party events because it means we won't have to host a party for him for a few years until he overcomes his issues with things like bouncy castles.</value>

    <value>Evan has shown signs of really picking up on things that we do around him lately. A few months ago we were watching my ladies football team play their final home game of the season. I had to take Evan with me because Caroline was away at a Karate event. We took his ball and played football on the pitch when it wasn't in use—he absolutely loved that. Every time I cheered for the team, Evan shouted *"Come on Tottenham"* making everyone in the stand laugh at how cute he was. We were all cheering for Burnham, but Evan was shouting Tottenham—love it! Whilst we were wandering around, he got a little excited and fell on the rough grass surrounding the pitch. This patch of grass was littered with stingy weeds and Evan ended up getting little stingy bumps on his face. We found a doc leaf and used a bit of saliva *(as you do)* and rubbed the doc leaf on his face because apparently that helps the bumps go down. I always thought it worked for me and I've fallen into some pretty nasty stingy bushes as a child. Someone always used to say to me, *"Doc leaves are never too far from a stingy bush because they are the cure."*  

Well it looks like Evan has remembered this little trick. I was sitting on the sofa with my shorts on exposing my white legs when Evan spotted a little graze from football. He wandered over with some pebbles from the garden and some bits of leaf that he'd pulled from a shrub in the garden. He said he was going to make me better. He placed a heap of pebbles on my knee and then gently rubbed them and the leaf pieces over my graze. *"That's all better now mummy."* It was so cute, he'd sort of remembered what I did but not quite.</value>

  <data name="y3Jul_14th" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My First Festival—Aged 2. How many of us can say that? Evan has just been to his first festival *"Legoland Live".* We've had these annual passes for Legoland, so we thought we'd try and make a note of some events that would be good to go to throughout the summer. Today was a special festival with all the favourite stars of children's TV *(Barney, Lazy Town, Pingu, Bob the Builder and lots more).*  

Because of the annual passes, we didn't feel the need to go early and get our money's worth because our entry was free, so we set off at lunch time to make the short 10 minute drive to Legoland. The roads were busy and we had to turn around and try an alternate route to get towards Windsor. I couldn't understand where all the traffic was heading—surely it wasn't Legoland!?!? After listening to a news bulletin our fears were realised, we were sitting in a traffic jam with other festival goers all trying to reach Legoland. 2 hours later we arrived, luckily Evan had become bored in the car and had fallen asleep. The nightmare journey hadn't ended, we were directed to this overflow area for cars where we were instructed that the car park was full and the park was almost at full capacity. We could still go in but the car had to go. We couldn't bear to go home because there is no way Evan would understand, he was so excited about this day out. I decided to drop Caroline and Evan off so that they could go to the park and I would go and find somewhere to park. Luckily I was able to find a spot on the grass verge outside Legoland and it wasn't long before I caught Caroline and Evan who were trudging up the hill towards the park.  

We went into the park, not realising that the festival event was being held in the field at the end of the car park. We let Evan go on some of his favourite rides like the Spinning Spider and the Flying Chairs. We queued up for the Dinosaur roller coaster that he liked last time we came, it took us about 30 minutes in this queue. When we finally reached the end, Evan refused to go on the ride. I couldn't believe it—we'd just queued for all that time and he point blank refused to get in. I was not amused, this seemed like a good time for us to get some lunch!  

After wandering around the park unable to find the festival, we decided to ask at the information desk. When they told us that it was outside the park, we decided we'd better head up before it ended. We did manage to get onto a new ride we'd not been on before, it was a train that went really fast; I couldn't stop giggling because it was throwing us everywhere! We stopped off for Legoland's famous chocolate covered waffles *(with sprinkles)* on the way out of the park.  

We managed to catch the last part of the festival and I actually thought it was a really well organised event. Evan thoroughly enjoyed himself dancing and waving the giant card board cut out of bob the builder. There was even a section in front of the stage *(looked like a mosh pit)* with lots of little children dancing, chanting and bopping around—It was so cute. Bob the builder was the headliner event and it made Evan's day to see him, Wendy and Spud the scarecrow.  

All three of us were absolutely shattered by the end of the day!</value>

    <value>Happy Birthday to me.... or Happy Birthday to Evan?  

Today was my 28th birthday—so close to the big 30! It was a Monday and we weren't doing anything special so I went to work as usual, stopping off at my local Krispy Kreme doughnut shop to collect 4 dozen doughnuts for the guys at work. I saved 3 doughnuts to take home as I knew we hadn't arranged a birthday cake so I planned to put some candles on my doughnuts and have a makeshift birthday cake.  

I wasn't sure if Evan would understand, but he seemed to know exactly what was going on this year. He wrote in his special birthday card for me and was really excited when it came to blowing out the candles. We filmed the little event on the camcorder and this year Evan knew the words. He did a great rendition of the Happy Birthday song for me and he helped me blow the candles out on the doughnuts.  

I'm not sure I really got a look in after that, Evan decided he was best equipped to open my cards and presents—though he did let me have them once he'd opened everything. We had a really lovely evening.</value>

  <data name="y3Aug_2nd" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's 10 years today! Caroline and I celebrated our 10th anniversary. We'd hoped to do something really special this year, originally planning to get married now that it has finally become legal to do so in the UK. We weren't able to do this due to a number of reasons, lack of time and changes financially. It is something we are still committed to do but probably when we're not spending £900 a month on nursery fees for Evan. Getting married will give us equal rights and it will mean that Evan really does have two co-parents in the eyes of the law.  

This week was a strange one for me, a very sad one indeed. A friend I used to work with died in a car crash on my birthday. She was a really lovely girl—always smiling. We used to bump into each other regularly at the gym during our lunch hour and she would often join us down the pub for a few drinks. We both left the Company within a month of each other, she was leaving to take up playing polo professionally. She spoke of her plans to play in South America and Australia and I was looking forward to reading about her successes. Becky followed her dreams and she finally made it, although only for a short time. I guess the message we can take from this is to never put off following your dreams. Life is so short and you should live each day to the fullest.  

Her accident happened local to me on a stretch of road in Winkfield that I use whenever the motorway is jammed. I've had to use it quite a lot over the past few weeks. This week I chose to take a detour one morning to lay some flowers in her memory. She had so many friends and will be greatly missed; I don't think I'll ever be able to drive down that road without thinking about her.  

I wasn't able to make it to her funeral because I had been off work that week with some awful stomach virus that both Evan and I picked up. My friend Trevor said she had a huge turn out on the day with so many people going to pay their respects that they couldn't all fit into the crematorium.

    <value>A success at last! I took Evan to the indoor play area Snakes and Ladder today. It's been a long time since we last went and I was interested to see how well he settled this time round. In the past it usually takes him a while to start playing as he'll be quite clingy to me to start with.  

He was much better this time round, he spent the whole time playing with everything, with one exception at first—*the bouncy castle.*  

I was determined to try and coax Evan onto the bouncy castle because I was sure he'd enjoy it once he got over the issues he had with the noise. I waited until the bouncy castle was empty and armed with a few plastic balls from the ball pit as a distraction, I persuaded Evan to go inside with me. It worked a treat, at first he just wanted cuddles but as soon as I started tossing the balls at the side of the wall he was convinced that it was fun. He loved it and hopefully the fear of the bouncy castle is now cured and he'll be able to enjoy them at the next birthday party he goes to!</value>

    <value>Oh the joys of nits. I collected Evan from nursery one evening and was told that he'd spent a lot of time scratching his head. With his hair being so fair it didn't take me long to spot the little bugs crawling around. __*(Shudder)*__ It's been a very long time since I saw a nit and at first I didn't think they looked like them but after a phone call to my mum we decided that they probably were. Aren't mums great, they always seem to know what to do in new circumstances like this. My mum never fails me and she's always full of insightful information when I haven't got a clue. I was due to go to football training that evening but I decided the nit issue needed to be resolved immediately and it wasn't something I could leave Caroline to deal with on her own.  

We weren't entirely sure of our plan of action but the psycological itchiness was starting to really irritate me and the cat flee comb—yes that's all we had to hand wasn't helping because nits are a lot smaller than cat flees. In the end we resorted to the reliable crew cut—I'm so glad we had a boy, it would have been too cruel to inflict this kind of hair cut on a little girl. Evan wasn't impressed as we had to wake him up to do this but when I said we were going to get rid of all the bugs he cooperated as much as any 2 year old would. It wasn't an immediate success because we spotted quite a few eggs left behind by his roots. We usually give Evan a grade 4 hair cut and I was hoping a grade 2 would eradicate them, but that was not the case here. We then spent the next 10 minutes pulling as many eggs out of his wet hair with our finger tips—yuk!  

I did get told off by my mum for shaving his hair off, instead I should have found an all night chemist. Oh well we live and learn from these situations. I went to the chemist the next day and they didn't recommend the solutions that you see advertised on TV, instead a good old nit comb and lots of conditioner. This nit comb I bought was £10! At that price, it had better work... I forgot to buy some cheap conditioner so the next evening Evan had the "Fructus Garnier" treatment instead! This nit comb worked a treat, it found another 6 or 7 eggs that we had originally missed. The most amusing part of this whole situation was when we arrived at nursery the morning after the shaved head. Everyone was saying *"ooh Evan you've had a lovely hair cut"* and his response was *"because of the bugs, I don't have bugs in my hair"*—It was rather amusing.</value>

    <value>I mentioned to Evan last month that Roary the racing car was going to be at Legoland. That probably wasn't the wisest move I have made as Evan doesn't really understand weeks, though he is starting to grasp days of the week and weekends now. As a result of that mishap, he's been talking about Legoland and Roary for a while now. Well the day finally arrived this month, we were off to see Roary. Caroline's family were off to Legoland this weekend as well so we made plans to meet up with them as it's much better to do these kinds of trips in a group. We learned our lesson from the Legoland Live experience earlier in the summer by leaving really early to get to the park by 10am. It was a wise decision as we got a car parking space right at the front of the park. Evan as usual had a great time, he'd been talking about the famous Ollie the Dragon roller coaster that we queued 30 minutes for last time before refusing to go on. We decided to give it another go this time as he was adamant that he wanted to go on it. There was 4 of us so we queued again for about 20 minutes this time and sure enough Evan started to cry as we steppe into the seats. Caroline just plonked him down and said *"stop crying, you'll like it".* He wasn't screaming like last time so the stewards let us keep him on. As soon as the ride started he stopped crying and enjoyed it just like the first time we went on it. I'm still not sure why he was crying in the first place.. *who knows...*  

We did a few new rides this time including the fire engine challenge, which he seemed to enjoy, though he got a little scared when we were rushing around trying to beat all the other people in the engines next to us. We came second, his Uncle Frank beat us all! Caroline headed off to see Roary with Evan at the end of the day whilst I queued for an hour with the adults for the big roller coaster. I'm not really a roller coaster fan, I find them terrifying but I still put myself through all the pain and do them just because... I think it's because I feel it in the stomach, like when you go over a hump back bridge—it makes my stomach clench and feel funny. A roller coaster has the same effect, Caroline on the other hand gets a head rush and feels nothing in her stomach. We bought the picture because I looked so terrified in the back where as Caroline's nieces just screamed and smiled. I let them keep the picture, though Caroline did find it amusing to look at.  

I joined Caroline and Evan at the Roary tent afterwards and it was absolutely great. Roary was a real little car, slightly larger than a go-kart, he moved around, made revving noises and his hat and wings moved up and down. It was great and it was probably Evan's highlight of the whole day. The guy looking after Roary let Evan climb over the haystacks to sit next to him so that I could get a great picture of them together. He couldn't stop smiling, he seemed really happy. My only concern is that Evan will now expect to see Roary the racing car at Legoland every time we visit. We woke up on Sunday morning to that exact question—*"Can I go to Legoland to see Roary mummy?"*  

Evan loves fire engines and this is one toy we don't really have, so when I spotted a lego fire engine in the shop with a working siren and lights, I just had to buy it for him. He's been playing with it a lot since our trip to Legoland, I wonder how long it will last.</value>

    <value>*Pants?! - What Pants...?*  

Evan has been wearing pants recently in an attempt to finally get him out of nappies in the day time. This is one benefits of being at nursery because he saw all his friends wearing pants and knickers and going to the toilet by themselves that he decided he wanted to do it as well.  

All was going well, we had Evan staying dry all day and then he'd only wear a nappy in the afternoon for the journey home in the car. He is only doing a wee on the toilet at the moment as we have this real issue with poo, he just won't tell us when he needs to go.  

However, we have since had a little setback and now Evan seems to be having 1 or 2 accidents every day. I'm struggling to get all the clothes washed as well as our usual wash load every day. We started to wonder if the pants training was maybe stressing him out a little bit and as a result he was rebelling.  

I tried a new tactic and offered him a treat of some sort if he could go the whole day without an accident and the nursery even created a little chart for him to use every time he goes to the toilet he can put a smiley face sticker on the chart. This seemed to be working until today... I arrived at nursery and immediately spotted that he was in his spare clothes.  

Today's accident was unlike any other he'd had before, he'd said to Lucy his carer that he needed to go to the toilet but instead of going, he promptly sat on the floor and wet himself. He then asked to put a sticker on his chart! Whilst they were cleaning him up, he then turned to Lucy and said *"I've just flushed my pants down the toilet"* (with a giggle at the end and a rebellious grin on his face). She couldn't believe it and at first she didn't but when they couldn't find the elusive pants, she then checked the toilet... They weren't there so we can only assume that they really did get flushed down the pipes; I just hope they don't end up causing a blockage further down!  

Well that's the end of that for now... Evan is back in nappies until he gets over this little rebellious phase and we'll just try again another time...  

It was actually rather funny when she told me but it is so hard to keep a straight face when you try to tell your children that they shouldn't do things like that.</value>

    <value>Evan would like to share with you *(just in case you haven't already seen it)* his favourite advert on TV in the UK. A few weeks ago we were watching [Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway](http://www.itv.com/saturdaynighttakeaway) when the latest advert for Cadbury's Dairy Milk came on. He absolutely loved it, he loves animals any way, but this Gorilla playing the drums was something different.  

Ever since that first viewing he now just expects me to make the Gorilla appear when we switch on the TV. He can now sing the song as well, which just sounds odd hearing a 2 year old singing along to Phil Collins. What's even funnier is that he keeps calling him Tom Collins, which happens to be a cocktail *- my my Evan, starting a bit young aren't we :).* We've managed to find the advert on You Tube, so now it's easier to show it to him when he wants to see it - it's all about the drums, he does a great impression of that part.

I'm sure you're all just desperate to see what we are raving about, well sit back and enjoy!

    <value>Today we went to see our neighbours as it was their little girl's 2nd birthday. She was having a little naked time before bed time when we arrived and I was amazed to see that at the age of 2 already completely potty trained *- take notes Evan!?* She was great, several times she just wandered over to her potty and went without even asking her parents. I think we need to rethink the whole potty training issue with Evan, I'm going to pick a weekend later in this month to just really try to get him used to going all the time instead of just the once and then expecting some kind of reward.  

Evan was really shy at first when Amber wanted to play and he just clung to me. Several times she tried to sit on the sofa next to him and his response was *"I don't want to, I'm watching TV!"*, it was extremely funny because there I was laughing at Evan telling this little naked girl to go away - wonder if he'll say the same if that happens in another 18 years or so.  

Once Amber had opened all the presents Evan started to interact a little more, they played with her tea set at her little children's table and chairs - very cute. By the end of the night Evan was very relaxed that even he decided to strip off and run around naked - he even used the grown ups toilet!  

Very enjoyable night; I will however miss our neighbours as they are moving to a bigger house next week.</value>

    <value>Evan had a birthday party to go to today. We travelled to one of these giant indoor play centres in Newbury to celebrate the 3rd birthday of a friend of his at nursery. Evan seems to be a popular little boy at nursery as he keeps getting invited to birthday parties. I was a little concerned when we went in because of the issues we have getting him to do things, he gets really scared.. As expected when all the other children ran onto the climbing area, Evan just stood there refusing to go on. I even said I would go with him, but he was not interested.. He just ran around on the floor down below calling his friends names as we all climbed up the equipment.   

I did manage to get him in the baby area which was for under 5's and eventually everyone decided to hang out in that area so he was able to mix and play with his friends again. I'm hoping he will grow out of this, but time and time again he shows no sign of getting over whatever fear it is that he has.. It's not like I don't take him to these places, we often go to Snakes &amp; Ladders *(the closest to us)* but even then it can take a while to get him comfortable. I just know he would love it if he'd get over what ever was stopping him from doing it.</value>

    <value>Oh my! What a day... Evan and I spent the weekend with my mum, which was great fun - she spoilt us and it was lovely to spend some quality time with her. I had a home football match to play in the afternoon, so we came home Sunday morning just in time for me to drop Evan off at home to be with Caroline and then I set off for football. I managed the first half of the football game before I was called out of the dressing room at half time to see Caroline standing there without Evan. I immediately asked where Evan was; I could see from her face that something wasn't quite right. She informed me that Evan was with our neighbour but we needed to take him to hospital because he had a raisin stuck up his nose. I was astonished - *"how the hell did that happen?"* was my initial response.. I couldn't get my football boots off quickly enough and just threw some clothes on over my kit before racing home to Evan.  

It didn't take us long to get to the hospital and I had all these thoughts running through my head as to why it happened and how the hell they were going to get it out. Shortly after arriving we were sent down to the Children's A+E department and Evan was quite happy to play with all the toys there.  

The issues happened when the nurse called his name. He would let her look up his nose but as soon as she went near him with the claws, he freaked out.. I'm not surprised, they were scary looking things and his nose was very tiny in comparison. We tried to restrain him, but this just made him panic more. She said we'd have to wait up to 3 hours for a Doctor to see him and then they would just get more people to pin him down. This thought scared the hell out of me, I said *"There must be another way, he really doesn't want those claw things near him".* 

The nurse reappeared with a senior colleague and they suggested a couple of things for me to try. I was horrified - *"Me?!?!?"* As it turns out I was the only person who could try these techniques because I was related to him. First we tried to cover his mouth and blow air up the unobstructed nostril. We did this twice, which made him sneeze. The raisin was still stuck, the second more intrusive technique was to block the unobstructed nostril and forcefully blow air into his mouth. This scared me and I protested that surely you're only supposed to do that to people who aren't breathing! They insisted it was the only other way, so as required I blew into his mouth, on the second attempt the raisin flew out of his nose covering the side of my face with baby nose gunk *- euuww lovely, just what I needed...* He found the whole thing uncomfortable and it made him cry a lot but we were glad to have the raisin out with his cooperation.  

Hopefully he will think twice about putting things up his nose in the future. We now have a handy tip for all our friends with kids for if this ever happens to them.</value>

    <value>This has been an odd month for the Middlebrook's, the month started with some high and low points. Evan had another birthday party to go to, this time in the theme of Fireman Sam, which he loved. He had lots of fire engines to play with. Once again he seemed interested in playing with the toys and not actually getting involved with the party games going on.. I guess he just likes playing with the toys! It's all about familiarity. Hopefully as he gets older, he'll be more interested in the actual party events. He does like going to parties though; is always excited leading up to the big day. He'd like it even more if he could help unwrap the presents.  

Other news from our household is the separation between Caroline and I. We have ended our 10 year relationship this month, which sees her heading back to Essex to be closer to her family and the inevitable sale of our family home. I'm hoping the housing market hangs in there whilst we sell our house. I was hoping that Caroline would remain a key figure in Evan's life but because of his age, she believes he is still young enough to forget about her and as a result of that, has chosen to not continue her parenting role. It's sad, but I respect her decision and will not try to convince her to change her mind.</value>

    <value>*"I bring myrrh"* was the line that Evan had to say in his nursery nativity play this year. Evan didn't falter when he appeared on the stage in his homemade King outfit. I wasn't sure when asked to supply the outfit whether he would wear it because he usually reacts funnily to odd looking clothes, but he really embraced this nativity play. He wanted to wear his King's crown every day.   

Evan will be moving up to the Butterfly room at nursery when we return from the Christmas holiday period. He has been having odd half day visits leading up to the end of term to help him transition easily. He will be reunited with his old play buddies Jos and Bradley. We'll miss his favourite member of the nursery staff Lucy who will remain in the Caterpillar room that he is moving up from.</value>

    <value>I tried to find a Roary the Racing car cake this year for Evan, but was unsuccessful in my attempts to get one made. So once again it fell on my hands to do the baking myself. I should have learned from the recent failure to make cup cakes that embarking on a real sized cake would ultimately fail on a much bigger scale.  

Evan and I were visiting Grandma this Christmas so we decided to take all the baking ingredients and cook the cake at her house. I realised my mistake with the cup cakes was that I should have used self-raising flour instead of plain flour. It was an American recipe and I thought all-purpose flour meant plain!  

I thought it would be a great idea to attempt to make a Red Velvet Cake even though I have never seen one in real life before. I followed all the instructions but became somewhat concerned when it said mix the eggs (yes plural) into the cake mixture. "hmmmm, but the recipe only says 1 egg" - is that a typo on the plural part or on the number part? I decided to just use 1 egg, oh boy, was I wrong... Cakes are supposed to rise, correct? Mine didn't, it looked like a biscuit and tasted horrible. We had to ditch the Red Velvet attempt and instead sent my brother up the shop to get some more ingredients and my mum made a new cake for us to use instead.</value>

    <value>It's Christmas! Evan was really into Christmas this year, it started as soon as I put up the Christmas tree. Within minutes he had been investigating the new addition to our living room and ended with him knocking the tree over. I was sitting at the table and saw it all happen in the patio window reflection. It didn't completely fall, because Evan somehow managed to catch it. The tree looked a little ruffled by the time I rescued it.  

Evan knew it was Christmas and Birthday time this year and if you asked him how old he was going to be, he would quite happily tell you 3!  

I was woken up at 3am on Christmas morning by Evan announcing that he was awake and ready to open presents. He was a little upset when I appeared from my mum's bedroom to direct him back to bed for a few hours, he cried and objected at first, but soon returned to the bed in my brother's bedroom that he was using.  

He got up again shortly after 7am but this was a more respectable hour. We chose a smallish looking present for him to open and play with to keep him amused until the real opening of presents occurred later on that morning.  

This year we must have chosen well because it took Evan a while to get through his presents as he insisted on playing with every toy for a good 30 minutes before opening the next.</value>

    <value>Today was Evan's 3rd birthday and most of his birthday presents had survived the Christmas day attempts by Evan to open more presents than he was supposed to. We had his uncle Neil, aunty Pascale and Izzy the dog join us today and we had lots of fun. Evan adores Izzy and as usual he wouldn't leave her alone. I bought him a car play mat for his birthday and Izzy became rather attached to it, using it as a bed to sleep on when she was tired.  

The house will never be quiet again. What is it with noisy toys being the most fun! It would be easier to count the toys that made no noise than the toys that made noises! So many toys required batteries this year, I think it's time to invest in a rechargeable battery pack. Evan seemed to thoroughly enjoy Christmas Day and his birthday on Boxing Day, it was lovely to see him actually understanding what was going on this year.</value>
